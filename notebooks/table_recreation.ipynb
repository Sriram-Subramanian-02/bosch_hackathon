Failure to follow the above mentioned instructions can result in injury or death to the vehicle occupants in an accident. Why didnt my airbag go off in a collision? (Inflation and non-inflation conditions of the airbag) There are many types of accidents in which the airbag would not be expected to provide additional protection. These include rear impacts, the second or third collisions in multiple impact accidents, as well as low speed impacts. WARNING  In order for side impact and curtain airbags to provide the best protection, both front seat occupants and both outboard rear occupants should sit in an upright position with the seat belts properly fastened. Importantly, children should sit in a proper child restraint system in the rear seat. When children are seated in the rear outboard seats, they must be seated in the proper child restraint system. Make sure to put the child restraint system as far away from the door side as possible, and secure the child restraint system in a locked position. Do not place any objects over the airbag. Also, do not attach any objects around the area the airbag inflates such as the door, side door glass, front and rear pillars, roof side rail. Do not hang other objects except clothes, especially hard or breakable objects. In an accident, it may cause vehicle damage or personal injury. Do not allow the passengers to lean their heads or bodies onto doors, put their arms on the doors, stretch their arms out of the window, or place objects between the doors and passengers when they are seated on seats equipped with side and/or curtain airbags. Do not attempt to open or repair the side curtain airbags yourself. If necessary, we recommend that the airbag be inspected by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer. Never try to open or repair any components of the side curtain airbag system. We recommend that the system be serviced by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer.', metadata={'image_ids': None, 'chunk_type': 'Text', 'page_number': 78, 'car_name': 'Hyundai Exter'}), Document(page_content='This Text is extracted from manual of Hyundai Exter. Doing so could result in injury, due to accidental deployment of the airbags or by rendering the SRS inoperative. If the SRS airbag warning light remains illuminated while the vehicle is being driven, we recommend that the system be inspected by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer. Airbags can only be used once we recommend that the system be replaced by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer. The SRS is designed to deploy the front airbags only when an impact is sufficiently severe. Additionally, the airbags will only deploy once. Seat belts must be worn at all times. Front airbags are not intended to deploy in side-impact, rear-impact or rollover crashes. In addition, front airbags will not deploy in frontal crashes below the deployment threshold. A child restraint system must never be placed in the front seat. The infant or child could be severely injured or killed by an airbag deployment in case of an accident. Children age 12 and under must always be properly restrained in the rear seat. Never allow children to ride in the front passenger seat. If a child over 12 must be seated in the front seat, move the seat as far back as possible. And the child must always be restrained in the seat properly. For maximum safety protection in all types of crashes, all occupants including the driver should always wear their seat belts whether or not an airbag is also provided at their seating position to minimize the risk of severe injury or death in the event of a crash. Do not sit or lean unnecessarily close to the airbag while the vehicle is in motion. Sitting improperly or out of position can result in serious or fatal injury in a crash. All occupants should sit upright with the seat back in an upright position, centered on the seat cushion with their seat belt on, legs comfortably extended and their feet on the floor until the vehicle is parked and the ignition key is removed. The SRS airbag system must deploy very rapidly to provide protection in a crash. If an occupant is out of position because of not wearing a seat belt, the airbag may forcefully contact the occupant causing serious or fatal injuries.

CHILD RESTRAINT SYSTEM Children riding in the car should sit in the rear seat and must always be properly restrained to minimize the risk of injury in an accident, sudden stop or sudden maneuver. According to accident statistics, children are safer when properly restrained in the rear seats than in the front seat. Larger children not in a child restraint should use one of the seat belts provided. You should be aware of the specific requirements in your country. Child and/ or infant safety seats must be properly placed and installed in the rear seat. You must use a commercially available child restraint system that meets the requirements of the Safety Standards of your country. Child restraint systems are designed to be secured in vehicle seats by the lap belt portion of a lap/shoulder belt. Children could be injured or killed in a crash if their restraints are not properly secured. For small children and babies, a child seat or infant seat must be used. Before buying a particular child restraint system, make sure it fits your car seat and seat belts, and fits your child. Follow all the instructions provided by the manufacturer when installing the child restraint system. WARNING  A child restraint system must be placed in the rear seat. Never install a child or infant seat on the front passengers seat. Should an accident occur and cause the passenger-side airbag to deploy, it could severely injure or kill an infant or child seated in an infant or child seat. Thus, only use a child restraint in the rear seat of your vehicle. A seat belt or child restraint system can become very hot if it is left in a closed vehicle on a sunny day, even if the outside temperature does not feel hot. Be sure to check the seat cover and buckles before placing a child there. When the child restraint system is not in use, store it in the luggage area or fasten it with a seat belt so that it will not be thrown forward in the case of a sudden stop or an accident. Children may be seriously injured or killed by an inflating airbag. All children, even those too large for child restraints, must ride in the rear seat.', metadata={'image_ids': None, 'car_name': 'Hyundai Exter', 'page_number': 55, 'chunk_type': 'Text'}), Document(page_content=\"This Table is extracted from manual of Hyundai Verna. The table provides information on the suitability of different seating positions for various mass groups regarding child safety and restraint systems. It offers insights into the usage of child restraint systems approved under ECE regulations for different weight categories of children across several seating positions.\\n\\nFor the 'Mass Group' category, the table distinguishes between several groups based on weight: Group 0 (up to 10kg), Group 0+ (up to 13kg), Group I (9-18kg), Group II (15-25kg), and Group III (22-36kg). These groups are relevant to the type of restraint system required for each weight bracket.\\n\\nSeating positions are divided into 'Front Passenger', 'Rear Outboard', 'Rear Center', and 'Intermediate Outboard' and 'Intermediate Center'. Of these, the 'Front Passenger' seat is the only position explicitly marked as unsuitable (denoted as X) for the lightest weight category, Group 0. Meanwhile, the 'Universal' category of restraint systems is applicable to all groups marked as U in the table, indicating that these seating positions are suitable for the corresponding mass groups. \\n\\nThe table aims to guide parents in selecting the appropriate child restraint systems and seating positions, ensuring the safety of their children according to their weight and the specific vehicle's features. It's important to note that the 'L' and 'B' categories mentioned in the text represent specialized child restraint systems and built-in restraints, respectively, both of which have their own unique considerations and applications.\", metadata={'image_ids': None, 'chunk_type': 'Table', 'page_number': 61, 'car_name': 'Hyundai Verna'})]\n",

Importantly, children should sit in a proper child restraint system in the rear seat. When children are seated in the rear outboard seats, they must be seated in the proper child restraint system. Make sure to put the child restraint system as far away from the door side as possible, and secure the child restraint system in a locked position. Do not place any objects over the airbag. Also, do not attach any objects around the area the airbag inflates such as the door, side door glass, front and rear pillars, roof side rail. Do not hang other objects except clothes, especially hard or breakable objects. In an accident, it may cause vehicle damage or personal injury. Do not allow the passengers to lean their heads or bodies onto doors, put their arms on the doors, stretch their arms out of the window, or place objects between the doors and passengers when they are seated on seats equipped with side and/or curtain airbags. Do not attempt to open or repair the side curtain airbags yourself. If necessary, we recommend that the airbag be inspected by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer. Never try to open or repair any components of the side curtain airbag system. We recommend that the system be serviced by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer.' metadata={'image_ids': None, 'chunk_type': 'Text', 'page_number': 78, 'car_name': 'Hyundai Exter'}\n",

If the SRS airbag warning light remains illuminated while the vehicle is being driven, we recommend that the system be inspected by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer. Airbags can only be used once we recommend that the system be replaced by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer. The SRS is designed to deploy the front airbags only when an impact is sufficiently severe. Additionally, the airbags will only deploy once. Seat belts must be worn at all times. Front airbags are not intended to deploy in side-impact, rear-impact or rollover crashes. In addition, front airbags will not deploy in frontal crashes below the deployment threshold. A child restraint system must never be placed in the front seat. The infant or child could be severely injured or killed by an airbag deployment in case of an accident. Children age 12 and under must always be properly restrained in the rear seat. Never allow children to ride in the front passenger seat. If a child over 12 must be seated in the front seat, move the seat as far back as possible. And the child must always be restrained in the seat properly. For maximum safety protection in all types of crashes, all occupants including the driver should always wear their seat belts whether or not an airbag is also provided at their seating position to minimize the risk of severe injury or death in the event of a crash. Do not sit or lean unnecessarily close to the airbag while the vehicle is in motion. Sitting improperly or out of position can result in serious or fatal injury in a crash. All occupants should sit upright with the seat back in an upright position, centered on the seat cushion with their seat belt on, legs comfortably extended and their feet on the floor until the vehicle is parked and the ignition key is removed. The SRS airbag system must deploy very rapidly to provide protection in a crash. If an occupant is out of position because of not wearing a seat belt, the airbag may forcefully contact the occupant causing serious or fatal injuries.

      "page_content='This Text is extracted from manual of Hyundai Exter. CHILD RESTRAINT SYSTEM Children riding in the car should sit in the rear seat and must always be properly restrained to minimize the risk of injury in an accident, sudden stop or sudden maneuver. According to accident statistics, children are safer when properly restrained in the rear seats than in the front seat. Larger children not in a child restraint should use one of the seat belts provided. You should be aware of the specific requirements in your country. Child and/ or infant safety seats must be properly placed and installed in the rear seat. You must use a commercially available child restraint system that meets the requirements of the Safety Standards of your country. Child restraint systems are designed to be secured in vehicle seats by the lap belt portion of a lap/shoulder belt. Children could be injured or killed in a crash if their restraints are not properly secured. For small children and babies, a child seat or infant seat must be used. Before buying a particular child restraint system, make sure it fits your car seat and seat belts, and fits your child. Follow all the instructions provided by the manufacturer when installing the child restraint system. WARNING  A child restraint system must be placed in the rear seat. Never install a child or infant seat on the front passengers seat. Should an accident occur and cause the passenger-side airbag to deploy, it could severely injure or kill an infant or child seated in an infant or child seat. Thus, only use a child restraint in the rear seat of your vehicle. A seat belt or child restraint system can become very hot if it is left in a closed vehicle on a sunny day, even if the outside temperature does not feel hot. Be sure to check the seat cover and buckles before placing a child there. When the child restraint system is not in use, store it in the luggage area or fasten it with a seat belt so that it will not be thrown forward in the case of a sudden stop or an accident. Children may be seriously injured or killed by an inflating airbag. All children, even those too large for child restraints, must ride in the rear seat.' metadata={'image_ids': None, 'car_name': 'Hyundai Exter', 'page_number': 55, 'chunk_type': 'Text'}\n",

Recommended SAE viscosity number CAUTION Always be sure to clean the area around any filler plug, drain plug, or dipstick before checking or draining any lubricant. This is especially important in dusty or sandy areas and when the vehicle is used on unpaved roads. Cleaning the plug and dipstick areas will prevent dirt and grit from entering the engine and other mechanisms that could be damaged. Engine oil viscosity (thickness) has an effect on fuel economy and cold weather operating (engine start and engine oil flowability). Lower viscosity engine oils can provide better fuel economy and cold weather performance, however, higher viscosity engine oils are required for satisfactory lubrication in hot weather.

The table provides a comprehensive list of lubricants and fluids recommended for vehicle maintenance. It offers a detailed overview of each fluid's volume and classification, ensuring drivers understand the specific requirements for their car's engine and powertrain performance.\\n\\nStarting with the engine oil, which is crucial for smooth engine operation, the table recommends using 3.6 liters (3.80 US quarts) of the latest API-certified (ILSAC Latest) oil for drain and refill purposes. This oil falls under the Energy Conserving Oil category, which helps reduce engine friction and improve fuel economy. The manual transmission fluid, specified at 1.3 to 1.4 liters (1.38 to 1.48 US quarts), adheres to API Serviced GL-4 and SAE 70W standards, ensuring smooth gear transitions. For automated manual transmissions, the recommended fluid fills a range of 1.16 to 1.27 US quarts.\\n\\nThe coolant, a mixture of antifreeze and water, is designed for aluminum radiators and has a volume of 5.5 liters (5.81 US quarts). This coolant helps maintain optimal engine temperature and is classified as an ethylene glycol-based solution.

WARNING If the brake/clutch system requires frequent additions of fluid this could indicate a leak in the brake/clutch system. We recommend that the vehicle be inspected by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer. WARNING If brake/clutch fluid comes in contact with your eyes, flush your eyes with clean water for at least 15 minutes and get immediate medical attention. NOTICE  Do not allow brake/clutch fluid to contact the vehicles body paint, because paint damage may occur. Never use brake fluid that has been exposed to open air for an extended time and dispose of it properly. Do not use the wrong type of brake/ clutch fluid. A few drops of mineral based oil such as engine oil in your brake system may damage the brake system parts.
