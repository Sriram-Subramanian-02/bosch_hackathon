Group I is designed for toddlers weighing 9 to 18 kg and aged between 9 months and 48 months, while Group II caters to younger children weighing 15 to 25 kg and approximately 3 to 7 years old.

The front passenger seat is generally not recommended for children, marked with an 'X' in the table, indicating it's unsuitable for the respective age group. However, the rear seats are assigned letters indicating the suitability of various CRS options. 'U' signifies that the position is suitable for universal-category restraints approved for the specific age group, while 'L' suggests it's appropriate for particular child restraints, which may include vehicle-specific, restricted, or semi-universal categories.\n",

These include the Malfunction Indication Lamp (MIL) and the Check Engine Lamp, both of which are colored amber. MIL will remain lit during any engine-related fault that may increase the vehicle's emission levels. If such a situation arises, the owner is advised to contact an authorized dealer for rectification. Similarly, the Check Engine Lamp illuminates continuously if there's a fault in the Engine Management System and requires a visit to the service center. \n",

      "The table outlines the various functions and features related to a car's climate control system, specifically referring to it as FATC (Fully Automatic Temperature Control). The system allows users to control the airflow distribution and temperature within the vehicle cabin. Starting with the Temperature Control Knob, it allows adjustments to the desired temperature. The Auto ON Selection Button likely enables an automatic mode for convenient operation. The AC Button activates the air conditioning, while the Fresh Air/Recirculation Button lets the driver choose between fresh external air or recirculated internal air. The OFF Button is self-explanatory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Display Unit showcases the climate information on the main display screen, and it's also mentioned that the FATC functions can be accessed and controlled through both the FATC control panel and the touchscreen display. The Rear Window Demister Button is employed to remove fog or condensation from the rear window. It's noteworthy that this function has a 15-minute continuous operation limit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another button mentioned is the Air Distribution Mode Button, which allows the driver to select the desired airflow mode. When in AUTO mode, the system regulates the airflow automatically, but users can override this with the MODE button, which cycles through different airflow modes with each press. The Max Defrost Button is dedicated to directing airflow towards the windscreen for faster defrosting, taking precedence over other mode selections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, there's mention of a button that controls the airflow to the foot wells. The system remembers the previous settings and reverts to them once the Max Defrost Button is turned off. The safety note emphasizes the importance of maintaining a clear view through the windows before driving, indicating that these climate control features should be used safely. Lastly, it's noted that the rear demister function only operates when the engine is running.\n",

      "\n",
      "The second section contains various safety and convenience features found in a vehicle. Under the category of Supplementary Restraint System (srs), which appears to relate to airbags, the number 12 is listed. This may refer to the total number of airbags in the vehicle or a specific code related to their functionality.

Unfortunately, the data provided is incomplete, and without further details, it is difficult to ascertain the exact specifications and features of the vehicle in question.\n",
      "The data provided appears to be a car manual, detailing various features and functions of a vehicle. The information is organized into different sections, with the first being about the opening and closing mechanisms of various parts.

Some of the notable features mentioned include child locks, anti-theft devices, and fuel lid access.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second section relates to safety features. It mentions the location of seat belts and highlights the presence of an immobilizer, anti-lock braking, and brake force distribution. There's also reference to an anti-sway control system, traction control, and airbag deployment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final section, titled Dashboard and Features, seems to focus on the internal controls and display systems. It covers aspects like the instrument cluster, which can be either a TFT or LCD screen. It also mentions telltale signs, audio reminders, and various switches located on the steering column, providing access to functions like headlamp leveling. \n",

The system allows users to control the airflow distribution and temperature within the vehicle cabin. Starting with the Temperature Control Knob, it allows adjustments to the desired temperature. The Auto ON Selection Button likely enables an automatic mode for convenient operation. The AC Button activates the air conditioning, while the Fresh Air/Recirculation Button lets the driver choose between fresh external air or recirculated internal air. The OFF Button is self-explanatory.\n",

      "The Display Unit showcases the climate information on the main display screen, and it's also mentioned that the FATC functions can be accessed and controlled through both the FATC control panel and the touchscreen display. The Rear Window Demister Button is employed to remove fog or condensation from the rear window. It's noteworthy that this function has a 15-minute continuous operation limit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another button mentioned is the Air Distribution Mode Button, which allows the driver to select the desired airflow mode. When in AUTO mode, the system regulates the airflow automatically, but users can override this with the MODE button, which cycles through different airflow modes with each press. The Max Defrost Button is dedicated to directing airflow towards the windscreen for faster defrosting, taking precedence over other mode selections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, there's mention of a button that controls the airflow to the foot wells. The system remembers the previous settings and reverts to them once the Max Defrost Button is turned off. The safety note emphasizes the importance of maintaining a clear view through the windows before driving, indicating that these climate control features should be used safely. Lastly, it's noted that the rear demister function only operates when the engine is running.\n",

There are two fuses rated at 5A with the same designation F4, which may cause confusion.\n",

      "Moving on to the final section, the 15A fuses include F3 for the ACC batt and OBD, F13 for power socket 1, and F15 for power socket 2. Meanwhile, the 20A fuses are F7, F8, and F9, which appear to be associated with different BCMs. Finally, F5, rated at 25A, is responsible for the heated rear screen BCM.\n",

      "It's important to note that the data seems to be presented in a jumbled manner, and a more ordered layout would likely aid in understanding the information better. The table includes some blank spaces and seems to have some content cut off, so a complete understanding of the data might be difficult without the full picture.\n",
      "The table provides information on the fuse ratings and their corresponding functions. The first row contains the heading 'Fuse No.', 'Function', and 'Fuse Rating'. The subsequent rows each list a fuse number, its associated function, and the fuse rating in amperes (A).\n",
      "\n",
      "The data reveals that the fuse ratings vary significantly, ranging from 5A to 30A. The functions associated with these fuses cover a wide range of vehicle operations. For instance, the 'F16' fuse, rated at 5A, is for the relay coil, while the 'F21' fuse with a higher rating of 30A powers the blower motor. There are also multiple fuses rated at 5A, such as 'F17' for the immobiliser and 'F19' for key-in and tele batt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, some fuses have dual listings for their functions. For example, the 'F4' fuse is responsible for both the accessories fuse and PEPS/blower RLY, while the 'F11' fuse covers IMMOB/EPAS/PEPS-IGN. This indicates that these particular fuses may serve multiple purposes in the vehicle's electrical system.\n",

The response time varies based on the location of the breakdown. Within city limits, the response time is guaranteed to be within 60 minutes. For breakdowns occurring on state or national highways, the response time extends to 90 minutes. Ghat roads and other off-highway locations are given a response time of 120 minutes, with a potential variation of plus or minus 120 minutes due to the challenging terrain and accessibility issues. The response times are contingent upon multiple factors, including the position, terrain, traffic conditions, and the time of day.
