4,"FUEL REQUIREMENTS Petrol engine Unleaded Your new vehicle is designed to perform optimally using unleaded fuel having an Octane Rating of RON (Research Octane Number) 91 / AKI (Anti-Knock Index) 87 or higher. (Do not use methanol blended fuels) Your new vehicle is designed to obtain maximum performance with UNLEADED FUEL, as well as minimize exhaust emissions and spark plug fouling. NOTICE NEVER USE LEADED FUEL. The use of leaded fuel is detrimental to the catalytic converter and will damage the engine control systems oxygen sensor and affect emission control. Also, severe wear and crack of piston ring, valve, etc. may occur and knocking noise may be heard from your engine. Never add any fuel system cleaning agents to the fuel tank other than what has been specified (We recommend that you consult an authorized HYUNDAI dealers for details.) WARNING  Do not top off after the nozzle automatically shuts off when refueling.  Always check that the fuel cap is installed securely to prevent fuel spillage in the event of an accident. 
",,
5,"Petrol containing alcohol and methanol Gasohol, a mixture of petrol and ethanol (also known as grain alcohol), and petrol or gasohol containing methanol (also known as wood alcohol) are being marketed along with or instead of leaded or unleaded petrol. Do not use gasohol containing more than 20% ethanol, and do not use petrol or gasohol containing any methanol. Either of these fuels may cause drivability problems and damage to the fuel system, engine control system and emission control system. Discontinue using gasohol of any kind if drivability problems occur. Vehicle damage or driveability problems may not be covered by the manufacturers warranty if they result from the use of: 1. Gasohol containing more than 20% ethanol. 2. Petrol or gasohol containing methanol. 3. Leaded fuel or leaded gasohol. CAUTION Never use gasohol which contains methanol. Discontinue use of any gasohol product which impairs drivability. Using Fuel Additives Using fuel additives such as: - Silicone fuel additive - MMT (Manganese, Mn) fuel additive - Ferrocene (iron-based) fuel additive - Other metallic-based fuel additives May result in cylinder misfire, poor acceleration, engine stalling, engine plugging, heavy knocking noise, damage to the catalyst, or abnormal corrosion, and may cause damage to the engine resulting in a reduction in the overall life of the powertrain. The Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) may illuminate. NOTICE Damage to the fuel system or performance problem caused by the use of these fuels may not be covered by your New Vehicle Limited Warranty. 
",,
6,"Use of MTBE HYUNDAI recommends avoiding fuels containing MTBE (Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether) over 15.0% vol. (Oxygen Content 2.7% weight) in your vehicle. Fuel containing MTBE over 15.0% vol. (Oxygen Content 2.7% weight) may reduce vehicle performance and produce vapor lock or hard starting. CAUTION Your New Vehicle Limited Warranty may not cover damage to the fuel system and any performance problems that are caused by the use of fuels containing methanol or fuels containing MTBE (Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether) over 15.0% vol. (Oxygen Content 2.7% weight.) Do not use methanol Fuels containing methanol (wood alcohol) should not be used in your vehicle. This type of fuel can reduce vehicle performance and damage components of the fuel system, engine control system and emission control system. Fuel Additives HYUNDAI recommends that you use unleaded petrol which has an Octane Rating of RON (Research Octane Number) 91 / AKI (Anti-Knock Index) 87 or higher. For customers who do not use good quality petrols including fuel additives regularly, and have problems starting or the engine does not run smoothly, one bottle of additives added to the fuel tank at every 10,000 km. Additives are available from your authorized HYUNDAI dealer along with information on how to use them. Do not mix other additives. Operation in foreign countries If you are going to drive your vehicle in another country, be sure to:  Observe all regulations regarding registration and insurance.  Determine that acceptable fuel is available.

7,"VEHICLE MODIFICATIONS This vehicle should not be modified. Modification of your vehicle could affect its per- formance, safety or durability and may even violate governmental safety and emis- sions regulations.  In addition, damage or performance problems resulting from any modification may not be covered under warranty.  If you use unauthorized electronic devices, it may cause the vehicle to operate abnormally, wire damage, battery discharge and fire. For your safety, do not use unauthorized electronic devices.

8,"9(+,&/(%5($.,1352&(66 No special break-in period is needed. By following a few simple precautions for the first 1,000 km (600 miles), you may add to the performance, economy and life of your vehicle:  Do not race the engine.  While driving, avoid sudden acceleration.  Do not maintain a single speed for long periods of time, either fast or slow. Varying the engine speed is needed to properly break-in the engine.  Avoid hard stops, except in emergencies, to allow the brakes to seat properly.  Fuel economy and engine performance may vary depending on vehicle break-in process and be stabilized after 6,000 km (4,000 miles). New engines may consume more oil during the vehicle break-in period.

","The table provides a comprehensive list of lubricants and fluids recommended for vehicle maintenance. It offers a detailed overview of each fluid's volume and classification, ensuring drivers understand the specific requirements for their car's engine and powertrain performance.

Starting with the engine oil, which is crucial for smooth engine operation, the table recommends using 3.6 liters (3.80 US quarts) of the latest API-certified (ILSAC Latest) oil for drain and refill purposes. This oil falls under the Energy Conserving Oil category, which helps reduce engine friction and improve fuel economy. The manual transmission fluid, specified at 1.3 to 1.4 liters (1.38 to 1.48 US quarts), adheres to API Serviced GL-4 and SAE 70W standards, ensuring smooth gear transitions. For automated manual transmissions, the recommended fluid fills a range of 1.16 to 1.27 US quarts.

The coolant, a mixture of antifreeze and water, is designed for aluminum radiators and has a volume of 5.5 liters (5.81 US quarts). This coolant helps maintain optimal engine temperature and is classified as an ethylene glycol-based solution. Brake and clutch fluids are also essential for efficient braking systems; the table suggests using 0.7 to 0.8 liters (0.7 to 0.8 US quarts) of FMVSS116 DOT-4 fluid for this purpose.

Fuel capacity is also mentioned, with a recommendation of 37 liters (9.8 US gallons) for the vehicle's fuel tank. It is noted that this is the filling capacity and not the actual tank capacity, which is larger to prevent fuel leakage and vapor creation. The table serves as a reliable guide for ensuring the proper functioning and longevity of your vehicle by using the right lubricants and fluids.

28,"Recommended SAE viscosity number CAUTION Always be sure to clean the area around any filler plug, drain plug, or dipstick before checking or draining any lubricant. This is especially important in dusty or sandy areas and when the vehicle is used on unpaved roads. Cleaning the plug and dipstick areas will prevent dirt and grit from entering the engine and other mechanisms that could be damaged. Engine oil viscosity (thickness) has an effect on fuel economy and cold weather operating (engine start and engine oil flowability). Lower viscosity engine oils can provide better fuel economy and cold weather performance, however, higher viscosity engine oils are required for satisfactory lubrication in hot weather. Using oils of any viscosity other than those recommended could result in engine damage. When choosing an oil, consider the range of temperature your vehicle will be operated in before the next oil change. Proceed to select the recommended oil viscosity from the chart. Temperature Range for SAE Viscosity Numbers Temperature C -30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 40 50 (F) -10 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 20W-50 15W-40 10W-30 0W-20, 0W-30, 5W-20, 5W-30 Petrol Engine Oil *1 : For better fuel economy, it is recommended to use the engine oil of a viscosity grade SAE 0W-20 (API Latest (ILSAC Latest)). However, if the engine oil is not available in your country, select the proper engine oil using the engine oil viscosity chart. 
","The table provides a comprehensive list of temperature ranges and their corresponding recommended SAE viscosity numbers for petrol engine oils. The temperature ranges are given in degrees Celsius and their Fahrenheit equivalents, with each range paired with the appropriate viscosity number. The first set of numbers ranges from -30 to 50 degrees Celsius and their corresponding SAE viscosity numbers include 20W-50, 15W-40, and 10W-30. 

There is also a selection of lower viscosity numbers for the second set of temperatures, which spans from -10 to 120 degrees Celsius. These include 0W-20, 0W-30, 5W-20, and 5W-30. According to the table, dusty or sandy conditions and unpaved roads require extra caution to prevent dirt from damaging the engine. The viscosity of engine oil affects fuel economy and cold weather performance, with lower viscosities offering better performance in these areas. The recommendation for improved fuel economy is SAE 0W-20 viscosity grade oil, but alternatives can be chosen based on the temperature range the vehicle will operate in.

33,"IMPORTANT SAFETY PRECAUTIONS You will find many safety precautions and recommendations throughout this section, and throughout this manual. The safety precautions in this section are among the most important. Always wear your seat belt A seat belt is your best protection in all types of accidents. Airbags are designed to supplement seat belts, not replace them. So even though your vehicle is equipped with airbags, ALWAYS make sure you and your passengers wear the seat belts, and wear them properly. Restrain all children All children under age 13 ride in your vehicle should be restrained properly in a rear seat, not the front seat. Infants and small children should be restrained in an appropriate child restraint. Larger children should use a booster seat with the lap/shoulder belt until they can use the seat belt properly without a booster seat. Airbag hazards While airbags can save lives, they can also cause serious or fatal injuries to occupants who sit too close to them, or who are not properly restrained. Infants, young children, and short adults are at the greatest risk of being injured by an inflating airbag. Follow all instructions and warnings in this manual. Driver distraction Driver distraction presents a serious and potentially deadly danger, especially for inexperienced drivers. Safety should be the first concern when behind the wheel and drivers need to be aware of the wide array of potential distractions, such as drowsiness, reaching for objects, eating, personal grooming, other passengers, and using cellular phones. Drivers can become distracted when they take their eyes and attention off the road or their hands off the wheel to focus on activities other than driving. To reduce your risk of distraction and an accident:  ALWAYS set up your mobile devices (for example, MP3 players, phones, navigation units, etc.) when your vehicle is parked or safely stopped.  ONLY use your mobile device when allowed by laws and conditions permit safe use. NEVER text or email while driving. Most countries have laws prohibiting drivers from texting. Some countries and cities also prohibit drivers from using handheld phones.  NEVER let the use of a mobile device distract you from driving. You have a responsibility to your passengers and others on the road to always drive safely, with your hands on the wheel as well as your eyes and attention on the road. 
",,
34,"Control your speed Excessive speed is a major factor in crash injuries and deaths. Generally, the higher the speed, the greater the risk, but serious injuries can also occur at lower speeds. Never drive faster than is safe for current conditions, regardless of the maximum speed posted. Keep your vehicle in safe condition Having a tire blowout or a mechanical failure can be extremely hazardous.

36," WARNING Loose objects Loose objects in the drivers foot area could interfere with the operation of the foot pedals, possibly causing an accident. Do not place anything under the front seats. WARNING Uprighting seat When you return the seatback to its upright position, hold the seatback and return it slowly and be sure there are no other occupants around the seat. If the seatback is returned without being held and controlled, the back of the seat could move forward or backward resulting in accidental injury. WARNING Driver responsibility for passengers Riding in a vehicle with seatback reclined could lead to serious or fatal injury in an accident. If a seat is reclined during an accident, the occupants hips may slide under the lap portion of the seat belt applying great force to the unprotected abdomen. The protection of your restraint system (seat belt and airbags) is greatly reduced by reclining your seat. Serious or fatal internal injuries could result. The driver must advise the passenger to keep the seatback in an upright position whenever the vehicle is in motion. WARNING Do not use a sitting cushion that reduces friction between the seat and passenger. The passengers hips may slide under the lap portion of the seat belt during an accident or a sudden stop. Serious or fatal internal injuries could result because the seat belt cant operate normally. WARNING Drivers seat  Never attempt to adjust seat while the vehicle is moving. This could result in loss of control, and an accident causing death, serious injury, or property damage.  Do not allow anything to interfere with the normal position of the seatback. Storing items against a seatback or in any other way interfering with proper locking of a seatback could result in serious or fatal injury in a sudden stop or collision.  Always drive and ride with your seatback upright and the lap portion of the seat belt snug and low across the hips. This is the best position to protect you in case of an accident.  In order to avoid unnecessary and perhaps severe airbag injuries, always sit as far back as possible from the steering wheel while maintaining comfortable control of the vehicle.

37," WARNING Rear seatbacks The rear seatback must be securely latched. If not, passengers and objects could be thrown forward resulting in serious injury or death in the event of a sudden stop or collision. Luggage and other cargo should be laid flat in the cargo area. If objects are large, heavy, or must be piled, they must be secured. Under no circumstances should cargo be piled higher than the seatbacks. Failure to follow these warnings cou ld result in serious injury or death in the event of a sudden stop, collision or rollover. No passenger should ride in the cargo area or sit or lie on folded seatbacks while the vehicle is moving. All passengers must be properly seated in seats and restrained properly while riding. When resetting the seatback to the upright position, make sure it is securely latched by pushing it forward and backwards. To avoid the possibility of burns, do not remove the carpet in the cargo area. Emission control devices beneath this floor generate high temperatures. WARNING After adjusting the seat, always check that it is securely locked into place by attempting to move the seat forward or backward without using the lock release lever. Sudden or unexpected movement of the drivers seat could cause you to lose control of the vehicle resulting in an accident. WARNING  Do not adjust the seat while wearing seat belts. Moving the seat cushion forward may cause strong pressure on the abdomen.  Use extreme caution so that hands or other objects are not caught in the seat mechanisms while the seat is moving.  Do not put a cigarette lighter on the floor or seat. When you operate the seat, gas may gush out of the lighter and cause fire.  If there are occupants in the rear seats, be careful while adjusting the front seat position.

44,"SEAT BELTS WARNING For maximum restraint system protection, the seat belts must always be used whenever the car is moving. Seat belts are most effective when seatbacks are in the upright position. Children age 12 and under must always be properly restrained in the rear seat. Never allow children to ride in the front passenger seat. If a child over 12 must be seated in the front seat, move the seat as far back as possible. And the child must always be restrained in the seat properly. Never wear the shoulder belt under your arm or behind your back. An improperly positioned shoulder belt can cause serious injuries in a crash. The shoulder belt should be positioned midway over your shoulder across your collarbone. Never wear a seat belt over fragile objects. If there is a sudden stop or impact, the seat belt can damage it. Avoid wearing twisted seat belts. A twisted belt cant do its job as well. In a collision, it could even cut into you. Be sure the belt webbing is straight and not twisted. Be careful not to damage the belt webbing or hardware. If the belt webbing or hardware is damaged, replace it. WARNING Seat belts are designed to bear upon the bony structure of the body, and should be worn low across the front of the pelvis or the pelvis, chest and shoulders, as applicable; wearing the lap section of the belt across the abdominal area must be avoided. Seat belts should be adjusted as firmly as possible, consistent with comfort, to provide the protection for which they have been designed. A slack belt will greatly reduce the protection afforded to the wearer. Care should be taken to avoid contamination of the webbing with polishes, oils and chemicals, and particularly battery acid. Cleaning may safely be carried out using mild soap and water. The belt should be replaced if webbing becomes frayed, contaminated or damaged. It is essential to replace the entire assembly after it has been worn in a severe impact even if damage to the assembly is not obvious. Belts should not be worn with straps twisted. Each belt assembly must only be used by one occupant; it is dangerous to put a belt around a child being carried on the occupants lap.

52,"Additional seat belt safety precautions Seat belt use during pregnancy The seat belt should always be used during pregnancy. The best way to protect your unborn child is to protect yourself by always wearing the seat belt. Pregnant women should always wear a lap-shoulder seat belt. Place the shoulder belt across your chest, routed between your breasts and away from your neck. Place the lap belt below your belly so that it fits SNUGLY across your hips and pelvic bone, under the rounded part of the belly. WARNING Pregnant women and patients are more vulnerable to any impacts on the abdomen during an abrupt stop or accident. If you are in an accident while pregnant, consult your doctor. To reduce the risk of serious injury or death to an unborn child during an accident, pregnant women should NEVER place the lap portion of the seat belt above or over the area of the abdomen where the unborn child is located. Seat belt use and children Infant and small children Most countries have Child Restraint System laws which require children to travel in approved Child Restraint System devices, including booster seats. The age at which seat belts can be used instead of the Child Restraint System differs among countries, so you should be aware of the specific requirements in your country, and where you are travelling. Infant and Child Restraint System must be properly placed and installed in a rear seat. For more information, refer to the Child Restraint Systemsin this chapter. WARNING ALWAYS properly restrain infants and small children in a Child Restraint System appropriate for the childs height and weight. To reduce the risk of serious injury or death to a child and other passengers,NEVER hold a child in your lap or arms when the vehicle is moving.The violent forces created during an accident will tear the child from your arms and throw the child against the interior of the vehicle. Small children are best protected from injury in an accident when properly restrained in the rear seat by a Child Restraint System that meets the requirements of the Safety Standards of your country. Before buying any Child Restraint System, make sure that it has a label certifying that it meets Safety Standard of your country. The Child Restraint System must be appropriate for your childs height and weight. Check the label on the Child Restraint System for this information. Refer to Child Restraint Systems in this chapter. Larger children Children under age 13 and who are too large for a booster seat should always occupy the rear seat and use the available lap/shoulder belts. A seat belt should lie across the upper thighs and be snug across the shoulder and chest to restrain the child safely. Check belt fit periodically. A childs squirming could put the belt out of position.In the event of an accident, children are afforded the best safety restrained by a proper Child Restraint System in the rear seats. 
",,
53,"If a larger child over age 13 must be seated in the front seat, the child must be securely restrained by the available lap/shoulder belt and the seat should be placed in the rearmost position. If the shoulder belt portion slightly touches the childs neck or face, try placing the child closer to the center of the vehicle.If the shoulder belt still touches their face or neck, they need to be returned to an appropriate booster seat in the rear seat. WARNING Always make sure larger childrens seat belts are worn and properly adjusted. NEVER allow the shoulder belt to contact the childs neck or face. Do not allow more than one child to use a single seat belt. Seat belt use and injured people A seat belt should be used when an injured person is being transported. Consult a physician for specific recommendations. One person per belt Two people (including children) should never attempt to use a single seat belt. This could increase the severity of injuries in case of an accident. Do not lie down Sitting in a reclined position when the vehicle is in motion can be dangerous. Even when buckled up, the protections of your restraint system (seat belts and/or airbags) is greatly reduced by reclining your seatback. Seat belts must be snug against your hips and chest to work properly. During an accident, you could be thrown into the seat belt, causing neck or other injuries. The more the seat back is reclined, the greater the chance for the passengers hips to slide under the lap belt or the passengers neck to strike the shoulder belt. WARNING  NEVER ride with a reclined seatback when the vehicle is moving.  Riding with a reclined seatback increases your chance of serious or fatal injuries in the event of a collision or sudden stop.  Driver and passengers should always sit well back in their seats with the seatbacks upright and should be belted properly.

54,"Care of seat belts Seat belt systems should never be disassembled or modified. In addition, care should be taken to assure that seat belts and belt hardware are not damaged by seat hinges, doors or other abuse. Periodic inspection All seat belts should be inspected periodically for wear or damage of any kind. Any damaged parts should be replaced as soon as possible. Keep belts clean and dry Seat belts should be kept clean and dry. If belts become dirty, they can be cleaned by using a mild soap solution and warm water. Bleach, dye, strong detergents or abrasives should not be used because they may damage and weaken the fabric. When to replace seat belts The entire seat belt assembly or assemblies should be replaced if the vehicle has been involved in an accident. This should be done even if no damage is visible.We recommend that you consult with an authorized HYUNDAI dealer.

55,"CHILD RESTRAINT SYSTEM Children riding in the car should sit in the rear seat and must always be properly restrained to minimize the risk of injury in an accident, sudden stop or sudden maneuver. According to accident statistics, children are safer when properly restrained in the rear seats than in the front seat. Larger children not in a child restraint should use one of the seat belts provided. You should be aware of the specific requirements in your country. Child and/ or infant safety seats must be properly placed and installed in the rear seat. You must use a commercially available child restraint system that meets the requirements of the Safety Standards of your country. Child restraint systems are designed to be secured in vehicle seats by the lap belt portion of a lap/shoulder belt. Children could be injured or killed in a crash if their restraints are not properly secured. For small children and babies, a child seat or infant seat must be used. Before buying a particular child restraint system, make sure it fits your car seat and seat belts, and fits your child. Follow all the instructions provided by the manufacturer when installing the child restraint system. WARNING  A child restraint system must be placed in the rear seat. Never install a child or infant seat on the front passengers seat. Should an accident occur and cause the passenger-side airbag to deploy, it could severely injure or kill an infant or child seated in an infant or child seat. Thus, only use a child restraint in the rear seat of your vehicle.  A seat belt or child restraint system can become very hot if it is left in a closed vehicle on a sunny day, even if the outside temperature does not feel hot. Be sure to check the seat cover and buckles before placing a child there.  When the child restraint system is not in use, store it in the luggage area or fasten it with a seat belt so that it will not be thrown forward in the case of a sudden stop or an accident.  Children may be seriously injured or killed by an inflating airbag. All children, even those too large for child restraints, must ride in the rear seat. 
",,
56," Children often squirm and reposition themselves improperly. Never let a child ride with the shoulder belt under their arm or behind their back. Always properly position and secure children in rear seat. Never allow a child to stand-up or kneel on the seat or floorboard of a moving vehicle. During a collision or sudden stop, the child can be violently thrown against the vehicles interior, resulting in serious injury. Never use an infant carrier or a child safety seat that hooks over a seatback, it may not provide adequate security in an accident. Seat belts can become very hot, especially when the car is parked in direct sunlight. Always check seat belt buckles before fastening them over a child. After an accident, we recommend that the system be checked by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer. If there is not enough space to place the child restraint system because of the drivers seat, install the child restraint system in the rear right seat. WARNING To reduce the chance of serious or fatal injuries:  Children of all ages are safer when restrained in the rear seat. A child riding in the front passenger seat can be forcefully struck by an inflating airbag resulting in serious or fatal injuries.  Always follow the instructions for installation and use of the child restraint maker.  Always make sure the child seat is secured properly in the car and your child is securely restrained in the child seat.  Never hold a child in your arms or lap when riding in a vehicle. The violent forces created during a crash will tear the child from your arms and throw the child against the cars interior.  Never put a seat belt over yourself and a child. During a crash, the belt could press deep into the child causing serious internal injuries.  Never leave children unattended in a vehicle - not even for a short time. The car can heat up very quickly, resulting in serious injuries to children inside. Even very young children may inadvertently cause the vehicle to move, entangle themselves in the windows, or lock themselves or others inside the vehicle.  Never allow two children, or any two persons, to use the same seat belt.

63,,"The table seems to categorize seating positions in a vehicle and the corresponding weight restrictions or mass groups associated with them. It starts by listing the seating positions, such as rear outboard right, rear center, and front passenger, across the rows. The columns represent different weight ranges or mass groups, with the center column indicating the seating positions' ability to accommodate the specified weight ranges. 

The rear outboard right and left seats are indicated with a simple 'U' across all weight ranges, which could mean these seats have no specific restrictions and can accommodate all the weight groups mentioned. The front passenger seat, however, is marked with an 'X' across the board, suggesting it might be restricted to certain weight ranges. 

The mass groups are divided into six categories, ranging from 'up to 10 kg' to '22 to 36 kg.' These seem to be infant and child weight groups, with the final group being the heaviest. The seating positions seem to correlate with these weight groups, where the rear seats can accommodate a wider range of weights, while the front passenger seat is more restricted. 

The table seems to be a quick reference for understanding what weight groups various seating positions in a vehicle cater to, possibly for the purpose of choosing the appropriate child safety seats or understanding seating capacity.

67,"How does the airbag system operate Airbags are activated (able to inflate if necessary) only when the ignition switch is placed to the ON or START position. Airbags inflate instantly in the event of serious frontal or side collision in order to help protect the occupants from serious physical injury. There is no single speed at which the airbags will inflate. Generally, airbags are designed to inflate based upon the severity of a collision and its direction. These two factors determine whether the sensors produce an electronic deployment/ inflation signal. Airbag deployment depends on a number of factors including vehicle speed, angles of impact and the density and stiffness of the vehicles or objects which your vehicle hits in the collision. The determining, factors are not limited to those mentioned above. The front airbags will completely inflate and deflate in an instant. It is virtually impossible for you to see the airbags inflate during an accident. It is much more likely that you will simply see the deflated airbags hanging out of their storage compartments after the collision. WARNING  Even in vehicles with airbags, you and your passengers must always wear the safety belts provided in order to minimize the risk and severity of injury in the event of a collision or rollover.  SRS and pretensioners contain explosive chemicals. If scraping a vehicle without removing SRS and pretensioners from a vehicle, it may cause fire. Before scraping a vehicle, we recommend that you contact an authorized HYUNDAI dealer.  Keep the SRS parts and wirings away from water or any liquid. If the SRS components are inoperative due to exposure to water or liquids, it may cause fire or severe injury. 
",,
68," In order to help provide protection in a severe collision, the airbags must inflate rapidly. The speed of airbag inflation is a consequence of extremely short time in which a collision occurs and the need to get the airbag between the occupant and the vehicle structures before the occupant impacts those structures. This speed of inflation reduces the risk of serious or life-threatening injuries in a severe collision and is thus a necessary part of airbag design. However, airbag inflation can also cause injuries which can include facial abrasions, bruises and broken bones because the inflation speed also causes the airbags to expand with a great deal of force. There are even circumstances under which contact with the steering wheel airbag can cause fatal injuries, especially if the occupant is positioned excessively close to the steering wheel. WARNING  To avoid severe personal injury or death caused by deploying airbags in a collision, the driver should sit as far back from the steering wheel airbag as possible. The front passenger should always move their seat as far back as possible and sit back in their seat.  Airbag inflates instantly in an event of a collision, passengers may be injured by the airbag expansion force if they are not in a proper position.  Airbag inflation may cause injuries including facial or bodily abrasions, injuries from broken glasses or burns.

69,"Noise and smoke When the airbags inflate, they make a loud noise and they leave smoke and powder in the air inside of the vehicle. This is normal and is a result of the ignition of the airbag inflator. After the airbag inflates, you may feel substantial discomfort in breathing due to the contact of your chest with both the seat belt and the airbag, as well as from breathing the smoke and powder. Open your doors and/or windows as soon as possible after impact in order to reduce discomfort and prevent prolonged exposure to the smoke and powder. Though smoke and powder are non- toxic, it may cause irritation to the skin (eyes, nose and throat, etc.). If this is the case, wash and rinse with cold water immediately and consult with the doctor if the symptom persists. WARNING When the airbags deploy, the airbag related parts in the steering wheel are very hot. To prevent injury, do not touch the airbag storage areas internal components immediately after an airbag has inflated. Do not install a child restraint on the front passengers seat (if equipped) Never place a rear-facing child restraint in the front passengers seat. If the airbag deploys, it would impact the rear- facing child restraint, causing serious or fatal injury. In addition, do not place front-facing child restraints in the front passengers seat either.

No objects (such as crash pad cover, cellular phone holder, cup holder, air fresheners or stickers) should be placed over or near the airbag modules on the steering wheel, instrument panel, windshield glass, and the front passengers panel above the glove box. Such objects could cause harm if the vehicle is in a crash severe enough to cause the airbags to deploy. Do not attach any objects on the front windshield and inside mirror. Do not tamper with or disconnect SRS wiring or other components of the SRS system. Doing so could result in injury, due to accidental deployment of the airbags or by rendering the SRS inoperative. If the SRS airbag warning light remains illuminated while the vehicle is being driven, we recommend that the system be inspected by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer. Airbags can only be used once we recommend that the system be replaced by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer. The SRS is designed to deploy the front airbags only when an impact is sufficiently severe. Additionally, the airbags will only deploy once. Seat belts must be worn at all times. Front airbags are not intended to deploy in side-impact, rear-impact or rollover crashes. In addition, front airbags will not deploy in frontal crashes below the deployment threshold.  A child restraint system must never be placed in the front seat. The infant or child could be severely injured or killed by an airbag deployment in case of an accident.  Children age 12 and under must always be properly restrained in the rear seat. Never allow children to ride in the front passenger seat. If a child over 12 must be seated in the front seat, move the seat as far back as possible. And the child must always be restrained in the seat properly.  For maximum safety protection in all types of crashes, all occupants including the driver should always wear their seat belts whether or not an airbag is also provided at their seating position to minimize the risk of severe injury or death in the event of a crash. Do not sit or lean unnecessarily close to the airbag while the vehicle is in motion.  Sitting improperly or out of position can result in serious or fatal injury in a crash. All occupants should sit upright with the seat back in an upright position, centered on the seat cushion with their seat belt on, legs comfortably extended and their feet on the floor until the vehicle is parked and the ignition key is removed.  The SRS airbag system must deploy very rapidly to provide protection in a crash. If an occupant is out of position because of not wearing a seat belt, the airbag may forcefully contact the occupant causing serious or fatal injuries.

81,"Airbag non-inflation conditions OAI3V033026 OAI3V033026 In certain low-speed collisions, the airbags may not deploy. The airbags are designed not to deploy in such cases because they may not provide benefits beyond the protection of the seat belts in such collisions. OAI3V033027 OAI3V033027 Front airbags are not designed to inflate in rear collisions, because occupants are moved backward by the force of the impact. In this case, inflated airbags would not be able to provide any additional benefit. Side airbags (if equipped) Side airbags (side impact and/or curtain airbags) are designed to inflate when an impact is detected by side collision sensors depending on the crash severity, speed or angles of impact resulting from a side impact collision. Although the front airbags (drivers and front passengers airbags) are designed to inflate only in frontal collisions, they also may inflate in other types of collisions if the front impact sensor detects a sufficient impact. Side airbags (side impact and/or curtain airbags) are designed to inflate only in side impact collisions, but they may inflate in other collisions if the side impact sensors detect a sufficient impact. If the vehicle chassis is impacted by bumps or objects on unimproved roads or sidewalks, airbags may deploy. Drive carefully on unimproved roads or on surfaces not designed for vehicle traffic to prevent unintended airbag deployment. OAI3V033047 OAI3V033047

The airbags are shown as a series of blue, inflated chambers extending from the roofline down the side windows. The image illustrates the design and function of side curtain airbags, which are designed to inflate in the event of a side impact collision to protect occupants from injury. The image is accompanied by text describing the conditions under which the airbags may deploy, such as in side impact collisions or if the vehicle chassis is impacted by bumps or objects on unimproved roads or sidewalks. The text also explains that the airbags are designed to deploy only in certain types of collisions, such as side impacts, and may not deploy in other types of collisions, such as rear impacts. This information is important for drivers and passengers to understand the limitations of airbags and to take appropriate safety precautions when driving.

82," Front airbags may not inflate in side impact collisions, because occupants move to the direction of the collision, and thus in side impacts, frontal airbag deployment would not provide additional occupant protection. OAI3V033049 OAI3V033049 In a slant or angled collision, the force of impact may direct the occupants in a direction where the airbags would not be able to provide any additional benefit, and thus the sensors may not deploy any airbags. Just before impact, drivers often brake heavily. Such heavy braking lowers the front portion of the vehicle causing it to ride under a vehicle with a higher ground clearance. Airbags may not inflate in this under-ride situation because deceleration forces that are detected by sensor may be significantly reduced by such under- ride collisions. OAI3V033050 OAI3V033050 Airbags do not inflate in rollover accidents because the vehicle can not detect rollover accident. However, side and/or curtain airbags may inflate when the vehicle is rolled over after side impact collision. OAI3V033029 OAI3V033029 
",,"<img file_path=(image_hyundai_exter_82_1.jpeg)>The image shows a silver SUV colliding with a black sedan. The impact point is on the driver's side of the SUV, where a blue starburst indicates the point of impact. The SUV's front airbags may not deploy in this type of collision because the force of the impact is directed towards the side of the vehicle, rather than the front. This means that the sensors that detect impact forces may not trigger the deployment of the airbags.  The text provided explains that airbags may not inflate in side impacts, angled collisions, or under-ride situations due to the direction of force and sensor limitations.  Additionally, the text clarifies that airbags do not inflate in rollover accidents because the vehicle cannot detect these situations. However, side and/or curtain airbags may deploy in rollover accidents if they occur after a side impact collision.

83,"SRS Care The SRS is virtually maintenance free and so there are no parts you can safely service by yourself. If the SRS airbag warning light does not Illuminate approximately 6sec after ignition switch turned ON, or continuously remains on, we recommend that the system be inspected by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer. We recommend that the any work on the SRS system, such as removing, installing or repairing, or any work on the steering wheel, the front passengers panel, front seats or roof rails be performed by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer. Improper handling of the SRS system may result in serious personal injury. WARNING Modification to SRS components or wiring, including the addition of any kind of badges to the pad covers or modifications to the body structure, can adversely affect SRS performance and lead to possible injury. For cleaning the airbag pad covers, use only a soft, dry cloth or one which has been moistened with plain water. Solvents or cleaners could adversely affect the airbag covers and proper deployment of the system.  Airbags may not inflate if the vehicle collides with objects such as utility poles or trees, where the point of impact is concentrated and the collision energy is absorbed by the vehicle structure.

"
84," No objects should be placed over or near the airbag modules on the steering wheel, instrument panel, and the front passengers panel above the glove box, because any such object could cause harm if the vehicle is in a crash severe enough to cause the airbags to inflate. If the airbags inflate, we recommend that the system be replaced by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer. Do not tamper with or disconnect SRS wiring, or other components of the SRS system. Doing so could result in injury, due to accidental inflation of the airbags or by rendering the SRS inoperative. If components of the airbag system must be discarded, or if the vehicle must be scrapped, certain safety precautions must be observed. An authorized HYUNDAI dealer knows these precautions and can give you the necessary information. Failure to follow these precautions and procedures could increase the risk of personal injury. If your car was flooded and has soaked carpeting or water on the flooring, you shouldnt try to start the engine; we recommend that you contact an authorized HYUNDAI dealer. Additional safety precautions  Never let passengers ride in the cargo area or on top of a folded-down back seat. All occupants should sit upright, fully back in their seats with their seat belts on and their feet on the floor.  Passengers should not move out of or change seats while the vehicle is moving. A passenger who is not wearing a seat belt during a crash or emergency stop can be thrown against the inside of the vehicle, against other occupants, or out of the vehicle.  Each seat belt is designed to restrain one occupant. If more than one person uses the same seat belt, they could be seriously injured or killed in a collision.  Do not use any accessories on seat belts. Devices claiming to improve occupant comfort or reposition the seat belt can reduce the protection provided by the seat belt and increase the chance of serious injury in a crash.  Passengers should not place hard or sharp objects between themselves and the airbags. Carrying hard or sharp objects on your lap or in your mouth can result in injuries if an airbag inflates.  Keep occupants away from the airbag covers. All occupants should sit upright, fully back in their seats with their seat belts on and their feet on the floor. If occupants are too close to the airbag covers, they could be injured if the airbags inflate. 
",,
85," Do not attach or place objects on or near the airbag covers. Any object attached to or placed on the front airbag covers could interfere with the proper operation of the airbags. Do not modify the front seats. Modification of the front seats could interfere with the operation of the supplemental restraint system sensing components in the airbags. Do not place items under the front seats. Placing items under the front seats could interfere with the operation of the supplemental restraint system sensing components and wiring harnesses. Never hold an infant or child on your lap. The infant or child could be seriously injured or killed in the event of a crash. All infants and children should be properly restrained in appropriate child safety seats or seat belts in the rear seat. WARNING Sitting improperly or out of position can cause occupants to be shifted too close to a deploying airbag, strike the interior structure or be thrown from the vehicle resulting in serious injury or death. Always sit upright with the seatback in an upright position, centered on the seat cushion with your seat belt on, legs comfortably extended and your feet on the floor. Adding equipment to or modifying your airbag-equipped vehicle If you modify your vehicle by changing your vehicles frame, bumper system, front end or side sheet metal or ride height, this may affect the operation of your vehicles airbag system. Airbag warning label OQXI032037 OQXI032037 Airbag warning labels are attached to alert the driver and passengers of potential risks of the airbag system. Be sure to read all of the information about the airbags that are installed on your vehicle in this Owners Manual.

The auto-lock feature securely locks all doors when the transmission shift lever is moved from the 'P' position to 'R', 'N', or 'D' while the engine is running. Driving at speeds above 15 km/h also engages the auto-lock mechanism. This feature can be deactivated.

The auto-unlock function conveniently unlocks all doors when the shift lever is placed in the 'P' position, also only when the engine is running. Additionally, when the ignition key is removed from the switch, the vehicle's doors unlock automatically. For instances without a smart key, removing the key cancels the auto-unlock function.

The table also allows users to enable service timing notifications and set preferences for various unit measurements, including speedometer, temperature, fuel economy, and tire pressure units.

Overall, these settings offer a blend of security and convenience, tailoring the driving experience to individual preferences.
The table details various vehicle features and their corresponding explanations. Notably, it describes auto-locking and auto-unlocking functions related to the doors of a car with a focus on the shift lever's positions and vehicle speed.

When the Manual/Automated manual transmission shift lever is moved from the Park position, the doors will automatically lock when transitioning to the Reverse, Neutral, or Drive positions, provided the engine is running. Conversely, moving the lever to the Park position will result in all doors unlocking automatically, also only when the engine is running. There is also an option to deactivate the auto-lock function.

The auto-lock mechanism engages when the vehicle reaches a speed of 15 km/h (9.3 mph). Additionally, the table mentions a welcome mirror and light feature, detailing how the outside rearview mirrors unfold and illuminate when unlocking the doors or when approached with the smart key.

The second half of the table allows users to configure various unit settings, including speedometer, temperature, fuel economy, and tire pressure units, catering to individual preferences.
The table contains information on various vehicle settings and preferences that a user can adjust according to their preferences. The first setting is the speedometer unit, which can be chosen between kilometers per hour (km/h) or miles per hour (MPH). The temperature unit, responsible for the vehicle's climate control, can be set to either Celsius (°C) or Fahrenheit (°F). The fuel economy unit is next, and it allows the selection between kilometers per liter (Km/L) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100km), or between US and UK gallons. Moving on, the tire pressure unit can be selected from three options: psi, kPa, or bar.

The table also explains some of the auto-locking and auto-unlocking features of the vehicle. When the manual or automated manual transmission shift lever is moved from the Park position, the doors will automatically lock when the vehicle is in Reverse, Neutral, or Drive modes. This feature is only functional when the engine is running. Conversely, when the vehicle is in motion, the doors will automatically lock once it reaches a speed of 15 km/h. There is also the option to deactivate the auto-lock function. As for unlocking, there are two scenarios explained. Firstly, when the ignition switch is set to the Off position and the engine is running, or the smart key is used, the doors will automatically unlock when moved to the Park position. Secondly, removing the key from the ignition switch will also unlock the doors. Additionally, there is an option to cancel the auto-unlock operation.

The final two settings mentioned in the table are related to convenience features. The service timing notification can be set to activate at a certain distance traveled or period. The welcome mirror and light settings enable the unfolding of the outside rearview mirrors and the illumination of a welcome light when the doors are unlocked. These features ensure a more personalized and welcoming experience when approaching the vehicle.

133,"STEERING WHEEL Motor driven power steering (MDPS) The system assists you with steering the vehicle. If the engine is off or if the power steering system becomes inoperative, the vehicle may still be steered, but it will require increased steering effort. Also, the steering effort becomes heavier as the vehicles speed increases and becomes lighter as the vehicles speed decreases for better control of the steering wheel. Should you notice any change in the effort required to steer during normal vehicle operation, we recommend that the system be checked by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer. NOTICE If the Motor driven power steering system does not operate normally, the warning light ( ) will illuminate on the instrument cluster. The steering wheel may become difficult to control or operate. Take your vehicle to an authorized HYUNDAI dealer and have the system checked as soon as possible. i Information The following symptoms may occur during normal vehicle operation: The steering effort may be high immediately after placing the ignition switch in the ON position. This happens as the system performs the MDPS system diagnostics. When the diagnostics is completed, the steering wheel will return to its normal condition. When the battery voltage is low, you might have to put more steering effort. However, it is a temporary condition so that it will return to normal condition after charging the battery. A click noise may be heard from the MDPS relay after the ignition switch is placed to the ON or LOCK/OFF position. Motor noise may be heard when the vehicle is at stop or at a low driving speed. When you operate the steering wheel in low temperature, abnormal noise may occur. If temperature rises, the noise will disappear. This is a normal condition. i Information WARNING Never adjust the steering wheel while driving. You may lose the steering control and cause severe personal injury, death or accidents.

151," Do not get back into a vehicle once you have begun refueling. You can generate a buildup of static electricity by touching, rubbing or sliding against any item or fabric capable of producing static electricity. Static electricity discharge can ignite fuel vapors causing a fire. If you must re-enter the vehicle, you should once again eliminate potentially dangerous static electricity discharge by touching a metal part of the vehicle, away from the fuel filler neck, nozzle or other petrol source, with your bare hand. When using an approved portable fuel container, be sure to place the container on the ground prior to refueling. Static electricity discharge from the container can ignite fuel vapors causing a fire. Once refueling has begun, contact between your bare hand and the vehicle should be maintained until the filling is complete. Use only approved portable plastic fuel containers designed to carry and store petrol.  When refueling, always move the shift lever to the N (Neutral) position (for Automated manual transmission) or first gear or R (Reverse, for manual transmission), set the parking brake, and place the ignition switch to the LOCK/OFF position. Sparks produced by electrical components related to the engine can ignite fuel vapors causing a fire.  Do not use matches or a lighter and do not smoke or leave a lit cigarette in your vehicle while at a gas station, especially during refueling.  Do not over-fill or top-off your vehicle tank, which can cause petrol spillage.  If a fire breaks out during refueling, leave the vicinity of the vehicle, and immediately contact the manager of the gas station and then contact the local fire department. Follow any safety instructions they provide.  If pressurized fuel sprays out, it can cover your clothes or skin and thus subject you to the risk of fire and burns. Always remove the fuel cap carefully and slowly. If the cap is venting fuel or if you hear a hissing sound, wait until the condition stops before completely removing the cap.  Always check that the fuel cap is installed securely to prevent fuel spillage in the event of an accident.

179,"NOTICE The refrigerant system should only be serviced by trained and certified technicians to insure proper and safe operation. The refrigerant system should be serviced in a well-ventilated place. Air conditioning system operation tips If the vehicle has been parked in direct sunlight during hot weather, open the windows for a short time to let the hot air inside the vehicle escape. After sufficient cooling has been achieved, switch back from the recirculation mode to the fresh mode. To help reduce moisture inside of the windows on rainy or humid days, decrease the humidity inside the vehicle by operating the air conditioning system with the windows and sunroof closed. During the air conditioning system operation, you may occasionally notice a slight change in engine speed as the air conditioning compressor cycles. This is a normal system operation characteristic. Use the air conditioning system every month only for a few minutes to ensure maximum system performance. When using the air conditioning system, you may notice clear water dripping (or even puddling) on the ground under the passenger side of the vehicle. This is a normal system operation characteristic. If you operate the air conditioner excessively, the difference between the temperature of the outside air and that of the windshield could cause the outer surface of the windshield to fog up, causing loss of visibility. In this case, set the mode selection button to the position and set the fan speed control knob to the lowest speed setting. i Information  When using the air conditioning system, monitor the temperature gauge closely while driving up hills or in heavy traffic when outside temperatures are high. Air conditioning system operation may cause engine overheating. Continue to use the blower fan but turn the air conditioning system off if the temperature gauge indicates engine overheating.  When opening the windows in humid weather, air conditioning may create water droplets inside the vehicle. Since excessive water droplets may cause damage to electrical equipment, air conditioning should only be used with the windows closed.

197,"The following conditions are normal and do not indicate radio trouble: AM broadcasts can be received at greater distances than FM broadcasts. This is because AM radio waves are transmitted at low frequencies. These long distance, low frequency radio waves can follow the curvature of the earth rather than travelling straight. In addition, they curve around obstructions resulting in better signal coverage. Fading - As your vehicle moves away from the radio station, the signal will weaken and sound will begin to fade. When this occurs, we suggest that you select another stronger station. Flutter/Static - Weak FM signals or large obstructions between the transmitter and your radio can disturb the signal causing static or fluttering noises to occur. Reducing the treble level may lessen this effect until the disturbance clears. FM broadcasts are transmitted at high frequencies and do not bend to follow the earths surface. Because of this, FM broadcasts generally begin to fade within short distances from the station. Also, FM signals are easily affected by buildings, mountains, and obstructions. This can lead to undesirable or unpleasant listening conditions which might lead you to believe a problem exists with your radio.

Do not inhale engine exhaust. If at any time you smell engine exhaust inside the vehicle, open the windows immediately. Exposure to CO can cause unconsciousness and death by asphyxiation. Be sure the exhaust system does not leak. The exhaust system should be checked whenever the vehicle is raised to change the oil or for any other purpose. If you hear a change in the sound of the exhaust or if you drive over something that strikes the underneath side of the vehicle, we recommend that the exhaust system be checked as soon as possible by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer. Do not run the engine in an enclosed area. Letting the engine idle in your garage, even with the garage door open, is a hazardous practice. Run the engine only long enough to start the engine and to move the vehicle out of the garage. Avoid idling the engine for prolonged periods with people inside the vehicle. If it is necessary to idle the engine for a prolonged period with people inside the vehicle, be sure to do so only in an open area with the air intake set at Fresh and fan control set to high so fresh air is drawn into the interior. Keep the air intakes clear. To assure proper operation of the ventilation system, keep the ventilation air intakes located in front of the windshield clear of snow, ice, leaves, or other obstructions. If you must drive with the tailgate open: Close all windows. Open instrument panel air vents. Set the air intake control at Fresh, the air flow control at Floor or Face, and the fan control set to high.

Visually check the tires for uneven wear and damage. Check under the vehicle for any sign of leaks. Be sure there are no obstacles behind you if you intend to back up. Before starting Make sure the hood, the tailgate and the doors are securely closed and locked. Adjust the position of the seat and steering wheel. Adjust the inside and outside rearview mirrors. Verify all of the lights work. Fasten your seatbelt. Check that all passengers have fastened their seatbelts. Check the gauges and indicators in the instrument panel and the messages on the instrument display when the ignition switch is in the ON position. Check that any items you are carrying are stored properly or fastened down securely. WARNING Stay focused on the task of driving. Driver distraction can cause accidents. Leave plenty of space between you and the vehicle in front of you. WARNING NEVER drink or take drugs and drive. Drinking or taking drugs and driving is dangerous and may result in an accident and SERIOUS INJURY or DEATH. Drunk driving is the number one contributor to the highway death toll each year. Even a small amount of alcohol will affect your reflexes, perceptions and judgment. Just one drink can reduce your ability to respond to changing conditions and emergencies and your reaction time gets worse with each additional drink. Driving while under the influence of drugs is as dangerous as or more dangerous than driving under the influence of alcohol. You are much more likely to have a serious accident if you drink or take drugs and drive. If you are drinking or taking drugs, dont drive. Do not ride with a driver who has been drinking or taking drugs. Choose a designated driver or call a taxi. To reduce the risk of SERIOUS INJURY or DEATH, take the following precautions:  ALWAYS wear your seat belt. All passengers must be properly belted whenever the vehicle is moving. For more information, refer to Seat Belts in chapter 3.  Always drive defensively. Assume other drivers or pedestrians may be careless and make mistakes.

When releasing the clutch pedal, release it slowly. The clutch pedal should always be released while driving. NOTICE To prevent unnecessary wear or damage to the clutch: Do not rest your foot on the clutch pedal while driving. Do not hold the vehicle with the clutch on an incline, while waiting for the traffic light, etc. Always depress the clutch pedal down fully to prevent noise or damage. Do not start with the 2nd (second) gear engaged except when you start on a slippery road. Depress the clutch pedal all the way and be careful not to depress the pedal again before returning to the upright position after you release the pedal. If you depress the pedal before returning to the original position repeatedly, it may cause the clutch system failure. Downshifting Downshift when you must slow down in heavy traffic or drive up a steep hill to prevent engine load. Also, downshifting reduces the chance of stalling and can accelerate when you need to increase your speed again. When the vehicle is going downhill, downshifting helps maintain safe speed by providing brake power from the engine and enables less wear on the brakes. NOTICE To prevent damage to the engine, clutch and transmission:  When downshifting from the 5th gear to the 4th gear, be careful not to inadvertently push the shift lever sideways engaging the 2nd gear. A drastic downshift may cause the engine speed to increase to the point the tachometer will enter the red- zone.  Do not downshift more than two gears at a time or downshift the gear when the engine is running at high speed (5,000 RPM or higher). Such a downshifting may damage the engine, clutch and the transmission.

213,"Good driving practices Never take the vehicle out of gear and coast down a hill. This is extremely dangerous. Dont ride the brakes. This can cause the brakes and related parts to overheat and malfunction. When you are driving down a long hill, slow down and shift to a lower gear. Engine braking will help slow down the vehicle. Slow down before shifting to a lower gear. This will help avoid over-revving the engine, which can cause damage. Slow down when you encounter cross winds. This gives you much better control of your vehicle. Be sure the vehicle is completely stopped before you shift into R (Reverse) to prevent damage to the transmission. Exercise extreme caution when driving on a slippery surface. Be especially careful when braking, accelerating or shifting gears. On a slippery surface, an abrupt change in vehicle speed can cause the drive wheels to lose traction and may cause loss of vehicle control resulting in an accident. WARNING WARNING To reduce the risk of SERIOUS INJURY or DEATH: ALWAYS wear your seatbelt. In a collision, an unbelted occupant is significantly more likely to be seriously injured or killed than a properly belted occupant. Avoid high speeds when cornering or turning. Do not make quick steering wheel movements, such as sharp lane changes or fast and sharp turns. The risk of rollover is greatly increased if you lose control of your vehicle at highway speeds. Loss of control often occurs if two or more wheels drop off the roadway and the driver over steers to reenter the roadway. In the event your vehicle leaves the roadway, do not steer sharply. Instead, slow down before pulling back into the travel lanes. HYUNDAI recommends you follow all posted speed limits. Do not use the engine brake (shifting from a higher gear to lower gear) rapidly on slippery roads. The vehicle may slip causing an accident.

215,"Automated Manual Transmission (AMT) operation The Automated Manual Transmission (AMT) has five forward speeds and one reverse speed. The individual speeds are selected automatically in the D (Drive) position. Features of the Automated Manual Transmission (AMT) The Automated Manual Transmission (AMT) can be thought of as an automatically shifting manual transmission. It gives the driving feel of a manual transmission. When D (Drive) is selected, the transmission will automatically shift through the gears similar to a conventional automatic transmission. Unlike a traditional automatic transmission, the gear shifting can sometimes be felt and heard as the actuators engage the clutches and the gears are selected. When the gear is shifting, you may sometimes hear operating noise. This is normal and does not indicate a problem with your transmission. The Automated Manual Transmission (AMT) adopts a dry-type single clutch, which is different from the torque converter of the automatic transmission. It shows better acceleration performance and increased fuel efficiency while driving but initial launch might be little bit slower than the automatic transmission.  As a result, gear shifts are sometimes more noticeable than a conventional automatic transmission and a light vibration during launching can be felt as the transmission speed is matched with the engine speed. This is a normal condition of the Automated Manual Transmission (AMT).  The dry-type clutch transfers torque more directly and provides a direct drive feeling which may feel different from a conventional automatic transmission with a torque converter. This may be more noticeable when launching the vehicle from a stop or when traveling at low, stop-and-go vehicle speeds.  When rapidly accelerating at a low vehicle speed, the engine RPM may increase highly depending on the vehicles driving condition.  For a smooth launch uphill, depress the accelerator pedal smoothly depending on the current conditions.  If you release your foot from the accelerator pedal at low vehicle speed, you may feel engine braking, which is similar to manual transmission.

216," When you turn the engine on and off, you may hear clicking sounds as the system goes through a self-test. This is a normal sound for the Automated Manual Transmission (AMT). During the first 1,500 km (1,000 miles), you may feel that the vehicle may not be smooth when accelerating at low speed. During this break-in period, the shift quality and performance of your new vehicle is continuously optimized. i Information - Creeping function The Creeping function helps the vehicle to start smoothly. If you take your foot off the brake pedal when the shift lever is either in R (Reverse), D (Drive) or M (Manual) position, the vehicle will start slowly without depressing the accelerator pedal. To disable the function, depress the brake pedal or pull up the parking brake lever.

If this occurs, pull over to a safe location, stop the vehicle with the engine running, apply the brakes and allow the clutch to cool for a few minutes with engine on. If you ignore this warning, the driving condition may become worse. You may experience abrupt shifts, jerkiness. To return to the normal driving condition, stop the vehicle and apply the foot brake. Then allow the transmission to cool for a few minutes with engine on. WARNING On an uphill road, never hold the vehicle at a stop using only the accelerator pedal or the creeping mode. This may cause clutch overheating and excessive damage, resulting in the reduction of the clutchs life cycle. i Information The AMT waring lamp may come on when clutch slip occurs excessively due to repeated stop-and-go driving on steep grades and when Hill Hold is maintained for a long time. In order to prevent waring lamp ON, use the brake during low speed driving on hill or when stopping the vehicle on an Uphill slope.  If the vehicle is held on a hill by using only the accelerator pedal or by creeping with brake pedal dis- engaged, the clutch may overheat which can result in damage. At this time, a warning lamp will appear on the cluster.  If the warning lamp is active, the foot brake must be applied.  Ignoring the warnings can lead to damage to the clutch and transmission. Clutch High temperature First warning  Under certain conditions, such as repeated stop-and-go launches on steep grades, sudden take off or acceleration, or other harsh driving conditions, the clutch temperature will increase excessively.  When the clutch temperature is high, the safe protection mode and warning lamp engages and the gear position indicator on the cluster blinks three times with a chime.

If this occurs, pull over to a safe location, stop the vehicle with the engine running, apply the brakes and allow the clutch to cool for a few minutes with engine on until the warning lamp disappear on the cluster. When possible, drive the vehicle smoothly. If any of the warnings continue to blink, for your safety, we recommend you contact an authorized HYUNDAI dealer and have the system checked. R (Reverse) Use this position to drive the vehicle backward. NOTICE Always come to a complete stop before shifting into R (Reverse) position. When moving to R (Reverse) position the gear is not shifted if the vehicle speed is over 3 km/h. Depress the brake pedal fully. If not, the brake press indicator will illuminate and the gear is not shifted. N (Neutral) The wheels and transmission are not engaged. Use N (Neutral) if you need to restart a stalled engine, or if it is necessary to stop with the engine ON. Always depress the brake pedal when you are shifting from N (Neutral) to another gear. WARNING Do not shift into gear unless your foot is firmly on the brake pedal. Shifting into gear when the engine is running at high speed can cause the vehicle to move very rapidly. You could lose control of the vehicle and hit people or objects. D (Drive) This is the normal forward driving position. The transmission will automatically shift to the appropriate gear position upon operation of the accelerator pedal and variation of vehicle speed. For extra power when passing another vehicle or driving uphill, depress the accelerator further until you feel the transmission downshift to a lower gear.

224,"Good driving practices Never move the shift lever from N (Neutral) to any other position with the accelerator pedal depressed. Be sure the vehicle is completely stopped before you attempt to shift into R (Reverse) or D (Drive). Do not move the shift lever to N (Neutral) when driving. Doing so may result in an accident because of a loss of engine braking and the transmission could be damaged. Driving uphill or downhill, always shift to D (Drive) when driving forward or to R (Reverse) when driving backwards, and check the gear position indicated on the cluster before driving. If you drive in the opposite direction of the selected gear, the engine will turn off and a serious accident might be occurred due to the degraded brake performance. Do not drive with your foot resting on the brake pedal. Even light, but consistent pedal pressure can result in the brakes overheating, brake wear and possibly even brake failure. Depressing both accelerator and brake pedals at the same time can trigger logic for engine power reduction to assure vehicle deceleration. Vehicle acceleration will resume after the brake pedal is released. When driving in Manual shift mode, slow down before shifting to a lower gear. Otherwise, the lower gear may not be engaged if the engine RPMs are outside of the allowable range.  Always apply the parking brake when leaving the vehicle. Do not depend on placing the transmission in N (Neutral) to keep the vehicle from moving.  Exercise extreme caution when driving on a slippery surface. Be especially careful when braking, accelerating or shifting gears. On a slippery surface, an abrupt change in vehicle speed can cause the drive wheels to lose traction and may cause loss of vehicle control resulting in an accident  Optimum vehicle performance and economy is obtained by smoothly depressing and releasing the accelerator. WARNING To reduce the risk of SERIOUS INJURY or DEATH:  ALWAYS wear your seatbelt. In a collision, an unbelted occupant is significantly more likely to be seriously injured or killed than a properly belted occupant.  Avoid high speeds when cornering or turning.  Do not make quick steering wheel movements, such as sharp lane changes or fast, sharp turns.  The risk of rollover is greatly increased if you lose control of your vehicle at highway speeds.  Loss of control often occurs if two or more wheels drop off the roadway and the driver over steers to reenter the roadway.  In the event your vehicle leaves the roadway, do not steer sharply. Instead, slow down before pulling back into the travel lanes.  HYUNDAI recommends you follow all posted speed limits.

225,"BRAKING SYSTEM Power brakes Your vehicle has power-assisted brakes that adjust automatically through normal usage. If the engine is not running or is turned off while driving, the power assist for the brakes will not work. You can still stop your vehicle by applying greater force to the brake pedal than typical. The stopping distance, however, will be longer than with power brakes. Pump the brake pedal only when necessary to maintain steering control on slippery surfaces. When descending a long or steep hill, shift to a lower gear and avoid continuous application of the brakes. Applying the brakes continuously will cause the brakes to overheat and could result in a temporary loss of braking performance. Wet brakes may impair the vehicles ability to safely slow down; the vehicle may also pull to one side when the brakes are applied. Applying the brakes lightly will indicate whether they have been affected in this way. Always test your brakes in this fashion after driving through deep water. To dry the brakes, lightly tap the brake pedal to heat up the brakes while maintaining a safe forward speed until brake performance returns to normal. Avoid driving at high speeds until the brakes function correctly. Disc brakes wear indicator When your brake pads are worn and new pads are required, you will hear a high pitched warning sound from your front or rear brakes. You may hear this sound come and go or it may occur whenever you depress the brake pedal. NOTICE To avoid costly brake repairs, do not continue to drive with worn brake pads. i Information When the brake pedal is depressed under certain driving conditions or weather conditions, you may temporarily hear a noise. This is normal and does not indicate a problem with your brakes. While driving on a road with deicing chemicals, brake noise or abnormal tire wear may occur due to deicing chemicals. In a safe traffic condition, additionally apply the brakes to remove deicing chemicals on the brake discs and pads. WARNING Take the following precautions: Do not drive with your foot resting on the brake pedal. This will create abnormal high brake temperatures, excessive brake lining and pad wear, and increased stopping distances. i Information Always replace brake pads as complete front or rear axle sets.

228,"Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) WARNING An Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) or an Electronic Stability Control (ESC) system will not prevent accidents due to improper or dangerous driving maneuvers. Even though vehicle control is improved during emergency braking, always maintain a safe distance between you and objects ahead of you. Vehicle speeds should always be reduced during extreme road conditions. The braking distance for vehicles equipped with ABS or ESC may be longer than for those without these systems in the following road conditions. Drive your vehicle at reduced speeds during the following conditions: Rough, gravel or snow-covered roads. On roads where the road surface is pitted or has different surface height. Tire chains are installed on your vehicle. The safety features of an ABS or ESC equipped vehicle should not be tested by high speed driving or cornering. This could endanger the safety of yourself or others. ABS is an electronic braking system that helps prevent a braking skid. ABS allows the driver to steer and brake at the same time. Using ABS To obtain the maximum benefit from your ABS in an emergency situation, do not attempt to modulate your brake pressure and do not try to pump your brakes. Depress your brake pedal as hard as possible. When you apply your brakes under conditions which may lock the wheels, you may hear sounds from the brakes, or feel a corresponding sensation in the brake pedal. This is normal and it means your ABS is active. ABS does not reduce the time or distance it takes to stop the vehicle. Always maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of you. ABS will not prevent a skid that results from sudden changes in direction, such as trying to take a corner too fast or making a sudden lane change. Always drive at a safe speed for the road and weather conditions. ABS cannot prevent a loss of stability. Always steer moderately when braking hard. Severe or sharp steering wheel movement can still cause your vehicle to veer into oncoming traffic or off the road. On loose or uneven road surfaces, operation of the anti-lock brake system may result in a longer stopping distance than for vehicles equipped with a conventional brake system. The ABS warning light ( ) will stay on for several seconds after the ignition switch is in the ON position. During that time, the ABS will go through self- diagnosis and the light will go off if everything is normal. If the light stays on, you may have a problem with your ABS.

It helps ensure the vehicle stays stable when accelerating or braking suddenly on wet, slippery and rough roads where traction over the four tires can suddenly become uneven. WARNING Take the following precautions when using the Vehicle Stability Management (VSM): ALWAYS check the speed and the distance to the vehicle ahead. The VSM is not a substitute for safe driving practices. Never drive too fast for the road conditions. The VSM system will not prevent accidents. Excessive speed in bad weather, slippery and uneven roads can result in severe accidents. VSM operation VSM ON condition The VSM operates when: The Electronic Stability Control (ESC) is on. Vehicle speed is approximately above 15 km/h (9 mph) on curve roads. Vehicle speed is approximately above 20 km/h (12 mph) when the vehicle is braking on rough roads. i Information Turning the ESC off does not affect ABS or standard brake system operation. 
",,
233,"When operating When you apply your brakes under conditions which may activate the ESC, you may hear sounds from the brakes, or feel a corresponding sensation in the brake pedal. This is normal and it means your VSM is active. Hill-Start Assist Control (HAC) (if equipped) Hill-Start Assist Control helps prevent the vehicle from rolling backwards when starting a vehicle from a stop on a hill. The system operates the brakes automatically for approximately 2 seconds (maximum of 5 seconds when the accelerator pedal is slightly depressed during HAC operation) and releases the brake after 2 seconds or when the accelerator pedal is depressed. WARNING Always be ready to depress the accelerator pedal when starting off an incline. Hill-Start Assist Control activates only for approximately 2 seconds (maximum of 5 seconds when the accelerator pedal is slightly depressed during HAC operation). i Information The VSM does not operate when: Driving on a banked road such as gradient or incline Driving in reverse. The ESC OFF indicator light is on. The MDPS (Motor Driven Power Steering) ( ) is on or blinks. WARNING If the ESC indicator light ( ) or the MDPS warning light ( ) stays on or blinks, your vehicle may have a malfunction with the VSM system. When the warning light illuminates we recommend that the vehicle be checked by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer as soon as possible. NOTICE Driving with wheels and tires with different sizes may cause the ESC system to malfunction. Before replacing tires, make sure all four tires and wheels are the same size. Never drive the vehicle with different sized tires and wheels installed. i Information  Hill-Start Assist Control does not operate when the gear is shifted to P (Park) or N (Neutral).  Hill-Start Assist Control activates even when the ESC (Electronic Stability Control) is off. However, it does not activate, when ESC does not operate normally.

234,"Emergency Stop Signal (ESS) The Emergency Stop Signal system alerts the driver behind by blinking the stop light when the vehicle is braked rapidly and severely. The system is activated when: The vehicle suddenly stops (vehicle speed is over 55 km/h and the vehicle deceleration at greater than 7 m/s2) The ABS is activating When the vehicle speed is under 40 km/h and the ABS deactivates or the sudden stop situation is over, the stop light blinking will stop. Instead, the hazard warning flasher will turn on automatically. The hazard warning flasher will turn off when the vehicle speed is over 10 km/h (6.2 mph) after the vehicle has stopped. Also, it will turn off when the vehicle is driven at low speed for some time. You can turn it off manually by pushing the hazard warning flasher switch. CAUTION The Emergency Stop Signal (ESS) system will not work if the hazard warning flasher is already on. Brake Assist System (BAS) (if equipped) The Brake Assistant System provides additional pressure when the brake pedal is momentarily and strongly depressed in a situation sudden braking is required whilst driving. The Brake Assistant System reduces the time for ABS (Anti-Lock Brake System) control to enter and consequently reduces the braking distance, by providing additional pressure up to the point of ABS intervention. BAS operation  When the vehicle speed is more than 30 km/h (20 mph) and the ABS control is not entered.  When the brake pedal is depressed strongly over a certain level.  When the friction of the road surface is above a certain level. BAS operation off  The vehicle speed is below 10 km/h (6 mph).  The brake pedal is depressed over a certain conditions.  The friction of the road surface is below a certain level. WARNING The system may not operate depending on drivers driving habit, the degree to which the brake pedal is depressed and the road surface condition. 
",,
235,"Good braking practices WARNING Whenever leaving the vehicle or parking, always come to a complete stop and continue to depress the brake pedal. Move the shift lever into the 1st gear (for manual transmission vehicle) or N (Neutral) position (for Automated Manual Transmission vehicle), then apply the parking brake, and place the ignition switch in the LOCK/OFF position. Vehicles with the parking brake not fully engaged are at risk for moving inadvertently and causing injury to yourself or others. Wet brakes can be dangerous! The brakes may get wet if the vehicle is driven through standing water or if it is washed. Your vehicle will not stop as quickly if the brakes are wet. Wet brakes may cause the vehicle to pull to one side. To dry the brakes, apply the brakes lightly until the braking action returns to normal, taking care to keep the vehicle under control at all times. If the braking action does not return to normal, stop as soon as it is safe to do so and we recommend that you call an authorized HYUNDAI dealer for assistance. DO NOT drive with your foot resting on the brake pedal. Even light, but constant pedal pressure can result in the brakes overheating, brake wear, and possibly even brake failure. If a tire goes flat while you are driving, apply the brakes gently and keep the vehicle pointed straight ahead while you slow down. When you are moving slowly enough for it to be safe to do so, pull off the road and stop in a safe location. Keep your foot firmly on the brake pedal when the vehicle is stopped to prevent the vehicle from rolling forward.

236,"63(&,$/'5,9,1*&21',7,216 Hazardous driving conditions When hazardous driving conditions are encountered such as water, snow, ice, mud or sand: Drive cautiously and allow extra distance for braking. Avoid sudden movements in braking or steering. If stuck in snow, mud, or sand, use second gear. Accelerate slowly to avoid spinning the drive wheels. WARNING Downshifting with an Automated manual transmission while driving on slippery surfaces can cause an accident. The sudden change in tire speed could cause the tires to skid. Be careful when downshifting on slippery surfaces. Use sand, rock salt, or other non-slip material under the drive wheels to provide traction when stalled in ice, snow, or mud. Rocking the vehicle If it is necessary to rock the vehicle to free it from snow, sand, or mud, first turn the steering wheel to the right and left to clear the area around your front wheels. Then, shift back and forth between the 1st and R (Reverse, for manual transmission vehicle) or R (Reverse) and a forward gear (for Automated manual transmission vehicle). Try to avoid spinning the wheels, and do not race the engine. To prevent transmission wear, wait until the wheels stop spinning before shifting gears. Release the accelerator pedal while shifting, and press lightly on the accelerator pedal while the transmission is in gear. Slowly spinning the wheels in forward and reverse directions causes a rocking motion that may free the vehicle. NOTICE If the tires spin at high speed, the tires can explode and you or others may be injured. Do not attempt this procedure if people or objects are anywhere near the vehicle. The vehicle can overheat causing an engine compartment fire or other damage. Spin the wheels as little as possible and avoid spinning the wheels at speeds over 56 km/h (35 mph) as indicated on the speedometer. NOTICE If you are still stuck after rocking the vehicle a few times, have the vehicle pulled out by a tow vehicle to avoid engine overheating, possible damage to the transmission, and tire damage. See Towing in chapter 8. 
",,
237,"Smooth cornering Avoid braking or gear changing in corners, especially when roads are wet. Ideally, corners should always be taken under gentle acceleration. Driving at night Night driving presents more hazards than driving in the daylight. Here are some important tips to remember: Slow down and keep more distance between you and other vehicles, as it may be more difficult to see at night, especially in areas where there may not be any street lights. Adjust your mirrors to reduce the glare from other drivers headlights. Keep your headlights clean and properly aimed. Dirty or improperly aimed headlights will make it much more difficult to see at night. Avoid staring directly at the headlights of oncoming vehicles. You could be temporarily blinded, and it will take several seconds for your eyes to readjust to the darkness. Driving in the rain Rain and wet roads can make driving dangerous. Here are a few things to consider when driving in the rain or on slick pavement:  Slow down and allow extra following distance. A heavy rainfall makes it harder to see and increases the distance needed to stop your vehicle.  Replace your windshield wiper blades when they show signs of streaking or missing areas on the windshield.  Be sure your tires have enough tread. If your tires do not have enough tread, making a quick stop on wet pavement can cause a skid and possibly lead to an accident. See Tire replacement in chapter 9.  Turn on your headlights to make it easier for others to see you.  Driving too fast through large puddles can affect your brakes. If you must go through puddles, try to drive through them slowly.  If you believe your brakes may be wet, apply them lightly while driving until normal braking operation returns. Hydroplaning If the road is wet enough and you are going fast enough, your vehicle may have little or no contact with the road surface and actually ride on the water. The best advice is SLOW DOWN when the road is wet. The risk of hydroplaning increases as the depth of tire tread decreases, refer to Tire replacement in chapter 9. 
",,
238,"Driving in flooded areas Avoid driving through flooded areas unless you are sure the water is no higher than the bottom of the wheel hub. Drive through any water slowly. Allow adequate stopping distance because brake performance may be reduced. After driving through water, dry the brakes by gently applying them several times while the vehicle is moving slowly. 
",,
239,"WINTER DRIVING Snow or icy conditions You need to keep sufficient distance between your vehicle and the vehicle in front of you. Apply the brakes gently. Speeding, rapid acceleration, sudden brake applications, and sharp turns are potentially very hazardous practices. During deceleration, use engine braking to the fullest extent. Sudden brake applications on snowy or icy roads may cause skids to occur. To drive your vehicle in deep snow, it may be necessary to use snow tires or to install tire chains on your tires. Always carry emergency equipment. Some of the items you may want to carry include tire chains, tow straps or chains, a flashlight, emergency flares, sand, a shovel, jumper cables, a window scraper, gloves, ground cloth, coveralls, a blanket, etc. Snow tires WARNING Snow tires should be equivalent in size and type to the vehicles standard tires. Otherwise, the safety and handling of your vehicle may be adversely affected. If you mount snow tires on your vehicle, make sure to use radial tires of the same size and load range as the original tires. Mount snow tires on all four wheels to balance your vehicles handling in all weather conditions. The traction provided by snow tires on dry roads may not be as high as your vehicles original equipment tires. Check with the tire dealer for maximum speed recommendations. We recommend you use snow tires when road temperature is below 7 C (45 F). i Information Do not install studded tires without first checking local and municipal regulations for possible restrictions against their use. i Information Tire chains Since the sidewalls of radial tires are thinner than other types of tires, they may be damaged by mounting some types of tire chains on them. Therefore, the use of snow tires is recommended instead of tire chains. Do not mount tire chains on vehicles equipped with aluminum wheels; if possible use a wire type chain. If tire chains must be used, Use wire-type chains with a thickness of less than 15 mm (0.59 in) and install the tire chain after reviewing the instructions provided with the tire chains. Damage to your vehicle caused by improper tire chain use is not covered by your vehicle manufacturers warranty. OAI3V063020 OAI3V063020 
",,"<img file_path=(image_hyundai_exter_239_1.png)>The image depicts a close-up view of a car's front tire with tire chains installed. The tire chains are made of a thick, durable metal and are wrapped around the tire in a diamond pattern. The chains are designed to provide extra traction on snow and ice, making it safer to drive in winter conditions. The tire chains are installed on a car with aluminum wheels and are a wire-type chain, as specified in the accompanying text. It is important to follow the instructions provided with the tire chains to avoid damaging your vehicle. The text also advises against using tire chains on vehicles with radial tires, as the thinner sidewalls can be damaged. It is recommended to use snow tires instead of tire chains, especially on vehicles with radial tires.  The image emphasizes the importance of having the appropriate equipment for safe winter driving.

"
240,"Chain Installation When installing tire chains, follow the manufacturers instructions and mount them as tightly possible. Drive slowly (less than 30 km/h (20 mph)) with chains installed. If you hear the chains contacting the body or chassis, stop and tighten them. If they still make contact, slow down until the noise stops. Remove the tire chains as soon as you begin driving on cleared roads. When mounting snow chains, park the vehicle on level ground away from traffic. Turn on the vehicle Hazard Warning Flasher and place a triangular emergency warning device behind the vehicle (if available). Always place the vehicle in N (Neutral), apply the parking brake and turn off the engine before installing snow chains. NOTICE When using tire chains: Wrong size chains or improperly installed chains can damage your vehicles brake lines, suspension, body and wheels. Use SAE S class or wire chains. If you hear noise caused by chains contacting the body, retighten the chain to prevent contact with the vehicle body. To prevent body damage, retighten the chains after driving 0.5-1.0 km (0.3-0.6 miles). Do not use tire chains on vehicles equipped with aluminum wheels. If unavoidable, use a wire type chain. Use wire chains less than 15 mm (0.59 in) wide to prevent damage to the chains connection. WARNING The use of tire chains may adversely affect vehicle handling: Drive less than 30 km/h (20 mph) or the chain manufacturers recommended speed limit, whichever is lower. Drive carefully and avoid bumps, holes, sharp turns, and other road hazards, which may cause the vehicle to bounce. Avoid sharp turns or locked wheel braking. i Information  Install tire chains on the front tires. It should be noted that installing tire chains on the tires will provide a greater driving force, but will not prevent side skids.  Do not install tire chains without first checking local and municipal regulations for possible restrictions against their use.

241,"Winter precautions Use high quality ethylene glycol coolant Your vehicle is delivered with high quality ethylene glycol coolant in the cooling system. It is the only type of coolant that should be used because it helps prevent corrosion in the cooling system, lubricates the water pump and prevents freezing. Be sure to replace or replenish your coolant in accordance with the maintenance schedule in chapter 9. Before winter, have your coolant tested to assure that its freezing point is sufficient for the temperatures anticipated during the winter. Check battery and cables Winter puts additional burdens on the battery system. Visually inspect the battery and cables as described in chapter 8. The level of charge in your battery can be checked by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer or a service station. Change to winter weight oil if necessary In some climates, it is recommended that a lower viscosity winter weight oil be used during cold weather. See chapter 2 for recommendations. If you arent sure what weight oil you should use, we recommend that you consult with an authorized HYUNDAI dealer. Check spark plugs and ignition system Inspect your spark plugs as described in chapter 9 and replace them if necessary. Also check all ignition wiring and components to be sure they are not cracked, worn or damaged in any way. To keep locks from freezing To keep the locks from freezing, squirt an approved de-icer fluid or glycerine into the key opening. If a lock is covered with ice, squirt it with an approved de-icing fluid to remove the ice. If the lock is frozen internally, you may be able to thaw it out by using a heated key. Handle the heated key with care to avoid injury. Use approved window washer anti- freeze in system To keep the water in the window washer system from freezing, add an approved window washer anti-freeze solution in accordance with instructions on the container. Window washer anti-freeze is available from an authorized HYUNDAI dealer and most auto parts outlets. Do not use engine coolant or other types of anti-freeze as these may damage the paint finish.

242,"Dont let your parking brake freeze Under some conditions, your parking brake can freeze in the engaged position. This is most likely to happen when there is an accumulation of snow or ice around or near the rear brakes or if the brakes are wet. If there is a risk the parking brake may freeze, apply it only temporarily while you put the shift lever in N (for Automated Manual Transmission) or in the first or reverse gear (for Manual Transmission) and block the rear wheels so the vehicle cannot roll. Then release the parking brake. Dont let ice and snow accumulate underneath Under some conditions, snow and ice can build up under the fenders and interfere with the steering. When driving in severe winter conditions where this may happen, you should periodically check underneath the car to be sure the movement of the front wheels and the steering components is not obstructed. Dont place foreign objects or materials in the engine compartment Placement of foreign objects or materials which prevent cooling of the engine, in the engine compartment, may cause a failure or combustion. The manufacturer is not responsible for the damage caused by such placement. Drive your vehicle when water vapor condenses and accumulates inside the exhaust pipes When the vehicle is stopped for a long time in winter while the engine is running, water vapor may condense and accumulate inside the exhaust pipes. Water in the exhaust pipes may cause noise, etc., but it is drained driving at medium to high speed. Carry emergency equipment Depending on the severity of the weather, you should carry appropriate emergency equipment. Some of the items you may want to carry include tire chains, tow straps or chains, flashlight, emergency flares, sand, shovel, jumper cables, window scraper, gloves, ground cloth, coveralls, blanket, etc.

265,"Tire pressure monitoring system WARNING Over-inflation or under-inflation can reduce tire life, adversely affect vehicle handling, and lead to sudden tire failure that may cause loss of vehicle control resulting in an accident. Each tire, including the spare (if provided), should be checked monthly when cold and inflated to the inflation pressure recommended by the vehicle manufacturer on the vehicle placard or tire inflation pressure label. (If your vehicle has tires of a different size than the size indicated on the vehicle placard or tire inflation pressure label, you should determine the proper tire inflation pressure for those tires.) As an added safety feature, your vehicle has been equipped with a tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) that illuminates a low tire pressure telltale when one or more of your tires is significantly under-inflated. Accordingly, when the low tire pressure telltale illuminates, you should stop and check your tires as soon as possible, and inflate them to the proper pressure. Driving on a significantly under-inflated tire causes the tire to overheat and can lead to tire failure. Under-inflation also reduces fuel efficiency and tire tread life, and may affect the vehicles handling and stopping ability. Please note that the TPMS is not a substitute for proper tire maintenance, and it is the drivers responsibility to maintain correct tire pressure, even if under-inflation has not reached the level to trigger illumination of the TPMS low tire pressure telltale. Your vehicle has also been equipped with a TPMS malfunction indicator to indicate when the system is not operating properly. The TPMS malfunction indicator is combined with the low tire pressure telltale. When the system detects a malfunction, the telltale will flash for approximately one minute and then remain continuously illuminated. This sequence will continue upon subsequent vehicle start-ups as long as the malfunction exists. When the malfunction indicator is illuminated, the system may not be able to detect or signal low tire pressure as intended. TPMS malfunctions may occur for a variety of reasons, including the installation of replacement or alternate tires or wheels on the vehicle that prevent the TPMS from functioning properly. Always check the TPMS malfunction telltale after replacing one or more tires or wheels on your vehicle to ensure that the replacement or alternate tires and wheels allow the TPMS to continue to function properly. NOTICE If any of the below happens, we recommend that you have the system checked by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer. 1. The Low Tire Pressure Telltale/ TPMS Malfunction Indicator does not illuminate for 3 seconds when the Engine Start/Stop button is pressed to the ON position or when the engine is running. 2. The TPMS Malfunction Indicator remains illuminated after blinking for approximately 1 minute. 3. The Low Tire Pressure Position Telltale remains illuminated. 
",,
266,"If you drive the vehicle for about 10 minutes at speeds above 25 km/h after replacing the low pressure tire with the spare tire, the following will happen: The TPMS malfunction indicator may blink for approximately 1 minute and then remain continuously illuminated because the TPMS sensor is not mounted on the spare wheel. NOTICE In winter or cold weather, the low tire pressure telltale may be illuminated if the tire pressure was adjusted to the recommended tire inflation pressure in warm weather. It does not mean your TPMS is malfunctioning because the decreased temperature leads to a proportional lowering of tire pressure. When you drive your vehicle from a warm area to a cold area or from a cold area to a warm area, or the outside temperature is greatly higher or lower, you should check the tire inflation pressure and adjust the tires to the recommended tire inflation pressure. WARNING Low pressure damage Significantly low tire pressure makes the vehicle unstable and can contribute to loss of vehicle control and increased braking distances. Continued driving on low pressure tires can cause the tires to overheat and fail. Low tire pressure telltale Low tire pressure position telltale and tire pressure telltale OAI3V083126 OAI3V083126 When the tire pressure monitoring system warning indicators are illuminated and a warning message displayed on the cluster display, one or more of your tires is significantly under-inflated.

267,"Changing a tire with TPMS If you have a flat tire, the Low Tire Pressure and Position telltales will come on. We recommend that the flat tire be repaired by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer as soon as possible or replace the flat tire with the spare tire. NOTICE It is recommended that you do not use a puncture-repairing agent not approved by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer or the equivalent specified for your vehicle to repair and/or inflate a low pressure tire. Tire sealant not approved by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer or the equivalent specified for your vehicle may damage the tire pressure sensor. The spare tire (if equipped) does not come with a tire pressure monitoring sensor. When the low pressure tire or the flat tire is replaced with the spare tire, the Low Tire Pressure Telltale will remain on. Also, the TPMS Malfunction Indicator will illuminate after blinking for one minute if the vehicle is driven at speed above 25 km/h (15.5 mph) for approximately 10 minutes. Once the original wheel equipped with a tire pressure monitoring sensor is reinflated to the recommended pressure and reinstalled on the vehicle, the Low Tire Pressure Telltale and TPMS Malfunction Indicator will go off within a few minutes of driving. TPMS (Tire Pressure Monitoring System) malfunction indicator The TPMS malfunction indicator will illuminate after it blinks for approximately one minute when there is a problem with the Tire Pressure Monitoring System. We recommend that the system be checked by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer. NOTICE If there is a malfunction with the TPMS, the low tire pressure position telltale will not be displayed even though the vehicle has an under-inflated tire. NOTICE The TPMS Malfunction Indicator may illuminate after blinking for one minute if the vehicle is near electric power supply cables or radio transmitters such as police stations, government and public offices, broadcasting stations, military installations, airports, transmitting towers, etc. Additionally, the TPMS Malfunction Indicator may illuminate if snow chains are used or electronic devices such as computers, chargers, remote starters, navigation, etc. This may interfere with normal operation of the TPMS. 
",,
268,"If the indicators do not extinguish after a few minutes we recommend to consult an authorized HYUNDAI dealer. Each wheel is equipped with a tire pressure sensor mounted inside the tire behind the valve stem (except for the spare tire). You must use TPMS specific wheels. It is recommended that you always have your tires serviced by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer. You may not be able to identify a tire with low pressure by simply looking at it. Always use a good quality tire pressure gauge to measure. Please note that a tire that is hot (from being driven) will have a higher pressure measurement than a tire that is cold. A cold tire means the vehicle has been sitting for 3 hours and driven for less than 1.6 km (1 mile) in that 3 hour period. Allow the tire to cool before measuring the inflation pressure. Always be sure the tire is cold before inflating to the recommended pressure. WARNING  The TPMS cannot alert you to severe and sudden tire damage caused by external factors such as nails or road debris.  If you feel any vehicle instability, immediately take your foot off the accelerator, apply the brakes gradually and with light force, and slowly move to a safe position off the road. WARNING Protecting TPMS Tampering with, modifying, or disabling the Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) components may interfere with the systems ability to warn the driver of low tire pressure conditions and/or TPMS malfunctions. Tampering with, modifying, or disabling the Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) components may void the warranty for that portion of the vehicle.

306,"Recommended engine coolant Use only soft (distilled) water in the coolant mixture. The engine in your vehicle has aluminum engine parts and must be protected by an ethylene-glycol-based coolant to prevent corrosion and freezing. DO NOT USE alcohol or methanol coolant or mix them with the specified coolant. Do not use a solution that contains more than 60% antifreeze or less than 35% antifreeze, which would reduce the effectiveness of the solution. For mixture percentage, refer to the following table. WARNING Radiator cap Do not remove the radiator cap when the engine and radiator are hot. Scalding hot coolant and steam may blow out under pressure causing serious injury. Changing the coolant We recommend that the coolant be replaced by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer. NOTICE Put a thick cloth or fabric around the radiator cap before refilling the coolant in order to prevent the coolant from overflowing into engine parts such as the alternator. WARNING Coolant Do not use radiator coolant or antifreeze in the washer fluid reservoir. Radiator coolant can severely obscure visibility when sprayed on the windshield and may cause loss of vehicle control or damage to paint and body trim. Ambient Temperature Mixture Percentage (volume) Antifreeze Water -15 C (5 F) 35 65 -25 C (-13 F) 40 60 -35 C (-31 F) 50 50 -45 C (-49 F) 60 40 
","The table details the recommended engine coolant mixture percentages for various ambient temperatures. It emphasizes the importance of using soft water in the coolant and avoiding alcohol or methanol coolants. The mixture should consist of antifreeze and water, with the percentages depending on the outside temperature. 

For temperatures as low as -15°C, a 35% antifreeze to 65% water ratio is suggested. This ratio changes to 40% antifreeze and 60% water for temperatures reaching -25°C. As the coldest temperature reaches -35°C, a 50-50 antifreeze to water ratio is recommended. In extremely cold weather, reaching -45°C, the antifreeze percentage should increase to 60% and the water percentage decrease to 40%. 

These recommendations aim to help drivers prepare for cold weather and protect their engines effectively.

322,"TIRES AND WHEELS Tire care For proper maintenance, safety and maximum fuel economy, you must always maintain recommended tire inflation pressures and stay within the load limits and weight distribution recommended for your vehicle. Recommended cold tire inflation pressures All tire pressures (including the spare) should be checked when the tires are cold. Cold Tires means the vehicle has not been driven for at least three hours or driven less than 1.6 km (one mile). Recommended pressures must be maintained for the best ride, top vehicle handling, and minimum tire wear. For recommended inflation pressure, refer to Tire and wheels in chapter 2. OAI3019023 OAI3019023 All specifications (sizes and pressures) can be found on a label attached to the drivers side center pillar. WARNING Tire underinflation Severe underinflation (70 kPa (10 psi) or more) can lead to severe heat build-up, causing blowouts, tread separation and other tire failures that can result in the loss of vehicle control leading to severe injury or death. This risk is much higher on hot days and when driving for long periods at high speeds. NOTICE  Underinflation also results in excessive wear, poor handling and reduced fuel economy. Wheel deformation also is possible. Keep your tire pressures at the proper levels. If a tire frequently needs refilling, we recommend that the system be checked by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer.  Overinflation produces a harsh ride, excessive wear at the center of the tire tread, and a greater possibility of damage from road hazards. NOTICE  Warm tires normally exceed recommended cold tire pressures by 28 to 41 kPa (4 to 6 psi). Do not release air from warm tires to adjust the pressure or the tires will be underinflated.  Be sure to reinstall the tire inflation valve caps. Without the valve cap, dirt or moisture could get into the valve core and cause air leakage. If a valve cap is missing, install a new one as soon as possible.

The recommended cold tire inflation pressure can be found on this label.  The recommended pressure should be maintained for the best ride, top vehicle handling, and minimum tire wear.  The label should be referenced for specific tire size and pressure information, as underinflation and overinflation can lead to various issues.</img>
"
323,"Checking tire inflation pressure Check your tires once a month or more. Also, check the tire pressure of the spare tire. How to check Use a good quality gage to check tire pressure. You can not tell if your tires are properly inflated simply by looking at them. Radial tires may look properly inflated even when theyre underinflated. Check the tires inflation pressure when the tires are cold. - Cold means your vehicle has been sitting for at least three hours or driven no more than 1.6 km (1 mile). Remove the valve cap from the tire valve stem. Press the tire gage firmly onto the valve to get a pressure measurement. If the cold tire inflation pressure matches the recommended pressure on the tire and loading information label, no further adjustment is necessary. If the pressure is low, add air until you reach the recommended amount. If you overfill the tire, release air by pushing on the metal stem in the center of the tire valve. Recheck the tire pressure with the tire gage. Be sure to put the valve caps back on the valve stems. They help prevent leaks by keeping out dirt and moisture. WARNING Tire Inflation Overinflation or underinflation can reduce tire life, adversely affect vehicle handling, and lead to sudden tire failure. This could result in loss of vehicle control and potential injury. NOTICE Tire pressure Always observe the following:  Check tire pressure when the tires are cold. (After vehicle has been parked for at least three hours or hasnt been driven more than 1.6 km (one mile) since startup.)  Check the pressure of your spare tire each time you check the pressure of other tires.  Never overload your vehicle. Be careful not to overload a vehicle luggage rack if your vehicle is equipped with one.  Worn, old tires can cause accidents. If your tread is badly worn, or if your tires have been damaged, replace them.

Abnormal wear is usually caused by incorrect tire pressure, improper wheel alignment, out-of-balance wheels, severe braking or severe cornering. Look for bumps or bulges in the tread or side of tire. Replace the tire if you find either of these conditions. Replace the tire if fabric or cord is visible. After rotation, be sure to bring the front and rear tire pressures to specification and check lug nut tightness. Refer to Tire and wheels in chapter 2. WARNING  Inspect your tires frequently for proper inflation as well as wear and damage. Always use a tire pressure gauge.  Tires with too much or too little pressure wear unevenly causing poor handling, loss of vehicle control, and sudden tire failure leading to accidents, injuries, and even death. The recommended cold tire pressure for your vehicle can be found in this manual and on the tire label located on the drivers side center pillar.  Worn tires can cause accidents. Replace tires that are worn, show uneven wear, or are damaged.  Remember to check the pressure of your spare tire. HYUNDAI recommends that you check the spare every time you check the pressure of the other tires on your vehicle.

325," WARNING Do not use the compact spare tire for tire rotation. Do not mix bias ply and radial ply tires under any circumstances. This may cause unusual handling characteristics that could result in death, severe injury or property damage. Wheel alignment and tire balance The wheels on your vehicle were aligned and balanced carefully at the factory to give you the longest tire life and best overall performance. In most cases, you will not need to have your wheels aligned again. However, if you notice unusual tire wear or your vehicle pulling one way or the other, the alignment may need to be reset. If you notice your vehicle vibrating when driving on a smooth road, your wheels may need to be rebalanced. NOTICE Improper wheel weights can damage your vehicles aluminum wheels. Use only approved wheel weights.

326,"Tire replacement WARNING Replacing tires To reduce the chance or serious or fatal injuries from an accident caused by tire failure or loss of vehicle control: Replace tires that are worn, show uneven wear, or are damaged. Worn tires can cause loss of braking effectiveness, steering control, and traction. Do not drive your vehicle with too little or too much pressure in your tires. This can lead to uneven wear and tire failure. When replacing tires, never mix radial and bias-ply tires on the same car. You must replace all tires (including the spare) if moving from radial to bias-ply tires. It is best to replace all four tires at the same time. If that is not possible, or necessary, then replace the two front or two rear tires as a pair. Replacing just one tire can seriously affect your vehicles handling. Using tires and wheels other than the recommended sizes could cause unusual handling characteristics and poor vehicle control, resulting in a serious accident. Wheels that do not meet HYUNDAIs specifications may fit poorly and result in damage to the vehicle or unusual handling and poor vehicle control. The works by comparing the speed of the wheels. Tire size can affect wheel speed. When replacing tires, all 4 tires must use the same size originally supplied with the vehicle. Using tires of a different size can cause the ABS (Anti-lock Brake System) and ESC (Electronic Stability Control) to work irregularly. (if equipped) If the tire is worn evenly, a tread wear indicator will appear as a solid band across the tread. This shows there is less than 1.6 mm (1/16 in.) of tread left on the tire. Replace the tire when this happens. Do not wait for the band to appear across the entire tread before replacing the tire. NOTICE When replacing the tires, recheck and tighten the wheel nuts after driving about 1,000 km (620 miles). If the steering wheel shakes or the vehicle vibrates while driving, the tire might be out of balance so align the tire balance. If the problem is not solved, we recommend that you contact an authorized HYUNDAI dealer. OEN076053 OEN076053

"
327,"Compact spare tire replacement (if equipped) A compact spare tire has a shorter tread life than a regular size tire. Replace it when you can see the tread wear indicator bars on the tire. The replaced compact spare tire should be the same size and design tire as the one provided with your new vehicle and should be mounted on the same compact spare tire wheel. The compact spare tire is not designed to be mounted on a regular size wheel, and the compact spare tire wheel is not designed to mount a regular size tire. Wheel replacement When replacing the metal wheels for any reason, make sure the new wheels are equivalent to the original factory units in diameter, rim width and offset. WARNING A wheel that is not the correct size may adversely affect wheel and bearing life, braking and stopping abilities, handling characteristics, ground clearance, body-to-tire clearance, snow chain clearance, speedometer and odometer calibration, headlight aim and bumper height. Tire traction Tire traction can be reduced if you drive on worn tires, tires that are improperly inflated or on slippery road surfaces. Tires should be replaced when tread wear indicators appear. Slow down whenever there is rain, snow or ice on the road, to reduce the possibility of losing control of the vehicle.

Uniform tire quality grading Quality grades can be found where applicable on the tire sidewall between tread shoulder and maximum chapter width. For example: TREAD wear 200 TRACTION AA TEMPERATURE A Tread wear The tread wear grade is a comparative rating based on the wear rate of the tire when tested under controlled conditions on a specified government test course. For example, a tire graded 150 would wear one-and-a-half times (1) as well on the government course as a tire graded 100. The relative performance of tires depends upon the actual conditions of their use, however, and may depart significantly from the norm due to variations in driving habits, service practices and differences in road characteristics and climate. These grades are molded on the side- walls of passenger vehicle tires. The tires available as standard or optional equipment on your vehicle may vary with respect to grade. 
",,
331,"Traction - AA, A, B & C The traction grades, from highest to lowest, are AA, A, B and C. Those grades represent the tires ability to stop on wet pavement measured under controlled conditions on specified government test surfaces of asphalt and concrete. A tire marked C may have poor traction performance. WARNING The traction grade assigned to this tire is based on straight-ahead braking traction tests, and does not include acceleration, cornering, hydroplaning, or peak traction characteristics. Temperature -A, B & C The temperature grades are A (the highest), B, and C, representing the tires resistance to the generation of heat and its ability to dissipate heat when tested under controlled conditions on a specified indoor laboratory test wheel. Sustained high temperature can cause the material of the tire to degenerate and reduce tire life, and excessive temperature can lead to sudden tire failure. Grades B and A represent higher levels of performance on the laboratory test wheel than the minimum required by law. WARNING Tire temperature The temperature grade for this tire is established for a tire that is properly inflated and not overloaded. Excessive speed, underinflation or excessive loading, either separately or in combination, can cause heat build-up and sudden tire failure.

344,"LIGHT BULBS NOTICE Be sure to replace the burned-out bulb with one of the same wattage rating. Otherwise, it may cause damage to the fuse or electric wiring system. We recommend that you consult an authorized HYUNDAI dealer to replace most vehicle light bulbs. It is difficult to replace vehicle light bulbs because other parts of the vehicle must be removed before you can get to the bulb. This is especially true for removing the headlight assembly to get to the bulb(s). Removing/installing the headlight assembly can result in damage to the vehicle. WARNING Prior to replacing a light, depress the foot brake, move the shift lever into the N (Neutral, for Automatic transmission vehicle) or neutral (for manual transmission vehicle), apply the parking brake, place the ignition switch in the LOCK/OFF position, and take the key with you when leaving the vehicle to avoid sudden movement of the vehicle and to prevent possible electric shock. Be aware the bulbs may be hot and may burn your fingers. i Information The headlight and tail light lenses could appear frosty if the vehicle is washed after driving or the vehicle is driven at night in wet weather. This condition is caused by temperature difference between the lamp inside and outside and, it does not indicate a problem with your vehicle. When moisture condenses in the lamp, it will be removed after driving with the headlight on. The removable level may differ depending on lamp size, lamp position and environmental condition. However, if moisture is not removed, we recommend that your vehicle is inspected by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer.

If the vehicle surface is too dirty (sand, dirt, dust, contaminant, etc.), clean the surface with water before washing the car. Waxing Wax the vehicle when water will no longer bead on the paint. Always wash and dry the vehicle before waxing. Use a good quality liquid or paste wax, and follow the manufacturers instructions. Wax all metal trim to protect it and to maintain its luster. Removing oil, tar, and similar materials with a spot remover will usually strip the wax from the finish. Be sure to re-wax these areas even if the rest of the vehicle does not yet need waxing. WARNING Wet brakes After washing the vehicle, test the brakes while driving slowly to see if they have been affected by water. If the braking performance is impaired, dry the brakes by applying them lightly while maintaining a slow forward speed. NOTICE Water washing in the engine compartment including high pressure water washing may cause the failure of electrical circuits located in the engine compartment.

355,"Bright-metal maintenance To remove road tar and insects, use a tar remover, not a scraper or other sharp object. To protect the surfaces of bright-metal parts from corrosion, apply a coating of wax or chrome preservative and rub to a high luster. During winter weather or in coastal areas, cover the bright metal parts with a heavier coating of wax or preservative. If necessary, coat the parts with non-corrosive petroleum jelly or other protective compound. Underbody maintenance Corrosive materials used for ice and snow removal and dust control may collect on the underbody. If these materials are not removed, accelerated rusting can occur on the underbody parts such as the fuel lines, frame, floor pan and exhaust system, even though they have been treated with rust protection. Thoroughly flush the vehicle underbody and wheel openings with lukewarm or cold water once a month, after off- road driving and at the end of each winter. Pay special attention to these areas because it is difficult to see all the mud and dirt. It will do more harm than good to wet down the road grime without removing it. The lower edges of the doors, rocker panels, and frame members have drain holes that should not clog with dirt; trapped water in these areas can cause rusting. WARNING After washing the vehicle, test the brakes while driving slowly to see if they have been affected by water. If the braking performance is impaired, dry the brakes by applying them lightly while maintaining a slow forward speed. Aluminum wheel maintenance The aluminum wheels are coated with a clear protective finish.  Do not use any abrasive cleaner, polishing compound, solvent, or wire brushes on aluminum wheels. They may scratch or damage the finish.  Clean the wheel when it has cooled.  Use only a mild soap or neutral detergent, and rinse thoroughly with water. Also, be sure to clean the wheels after driving on salted roads. This helps prevent corrosion.  Avoid washing the wheels with high- speed car wash brushes.  Do not use any alkaline or acid detergent. It may damage and corrode the aluminum wheels coated with a clear protective finish.

356,"Corrosion protection Protecting your vehicle from corro- sion By using the most advanced design and construction practices to combat corrosion, we produce vehicles of the highest quality. However, this is only part of the job. To achieve the long-term corrosion resistance your vehicle can deliver, the owners cooperation and assistance is also required. Common causes of corrosion The most common causes of corrosion on your vehicle are: Road salt, dirt and moisture that is allowed to accumulate underneath the vehicle. Removal of paint or protective coatings by stones, gravel, abrasion or minor scrapes and dents which leave unprotected metal exposed to corrosion. High-corrosion areas If you live in an area where your vehicle is regularly exposed to corrosive materials, corrosion protection is particularly important. Some of the common causes of accelerated corrosion are road salts, dust control chemicals, ocean air and industrial pollution. Moisture breeds corrosion Moisture creates the conditions in which corrosion is most likely to occur. For example, corrosion is accelerated by high humidity, particularly when temperatures are just above freezing. In such conditions, the corrosive material is kept in contact with the vehicles surface by moisture that slowly evaporates. Mud is particularly corrosive because it dries slowly and holds moisture in contact with the vehicle. Although the mud appears to be dry, it can still retain moisture and promote corrosion. High temperatures can also accelerate corrosion of parts that are not properly ventilated so the moisture can be dispersed. For all these reasons, it is particularly important to keep your vehicle clean and free of mud or accumulations of other materials. This applies not only to the visible surfaces but particularly to the underside of the vehicle. To help prevent corrosion You can help prevent corrosion from getting started by observing the following: 
",,
357,"Keep your vehicle clean The best way to prevent corrosion is to keep your vehicle clean and free of corrosive materials. Attention to the underside of the vehicle is particularly important. If you live in a high-corrosion area where road salts are used, near the ocean, areas with industrial pollution, acid rain, etc., you should take extra care to prevent corrosion. In winter, hose off the underside of your vehicle at least once a month and be sure to clean the underside thoroughly when winter is over. When cleaning underneath the vehicle, give particular attention to the components under the fenders and other areas that are hidden from view. Do a thorough job; just dampening the accumulated mud rather than washing it away will accelerate corrosion rather than prevent it. Water under high pressure and steam are particularly effective in removing accumulated mud and corrosive materials. When cleaning lower door panels, rocker panels and frame members, be sure that drain holes are kept open so that moisture can escape and not be trapped inside to accelerate corrosion. Keep your garage dry Dont park your vehicle in a damp, poorly ventilated garage. This creates a favorable environment for corrosion. This is particularly true if you wash your vehicle in the garage or drive it into the garage when it is still wet or covered with snow, ice or mud. Even a heated garage can contribute to corrosion unless it is well ventilated so moisture is dispersed. Keep paint and trim in good condition Scratches or chips in the finish should be covered with touch-up paint as soon as possible to reduce the possibility of corrosion. If bare metal is showing through, the attention of a qualified body and paint shop is recommended. Bird droppings : Bird droppings are highly corrosive and may damage painted surfaces in just a few hours. Always remove bird droppings as soon as possible. Dont neglect the interior Moisture can collect under the floor mats and carpeting and cause corrosion. Check under the mats periodically to be sure the carpeting is dry. Use particular care if you carry fertilizers, cleaning materials or chemicals in the vehicle. These should be carried only in proper containers and any spills or leaks should be cleaned up, flushed with clean water and thoroughly dried.

358,"Interior care Interior general precautions Prevent chemicals such as perfume, cosmetic oil, sun cream, hand cleaner, and air freshener from contacting the interior parts because they may cause damage or discoloration. If they do contact the interior parts, wipe them off immediately. See the instructions that follow for the proper way to clean vehicle interior surfaces. NOTICE Never allow water or other liquids to come in contact with electrical/ electronic components inside the vehicle as this may damage them. NOTICE When cleaning leather products (steering wheel, seats etc.), use neutral detergents or low alcohol content solutions. If you use high alcohol content solutions or acid/alkaline detergents, the color of the leather may fade or the surface may get stripped off. Cleaning the upholstery and interior trim Vehicle interior surfaces (if equipped) Remove dust and loose dirt from interior surfaces with a whisk broom or a vacuum cleaner. If necessary, clean interior surfaces with a mixture of warm water and mild non- detergent cleaner (test all cleaners on a concealed area before use). Fabric (if equipped) Remove dust and loose dirt from fabric with a whisk broom or vacuum cleaner. Clean with a mild soap solution recommended for upholstery or carpets. Remove fresh spots immediately with a fabric spot cleaner. If fresh spots do not receive immediate attention, the fabric can be stained and its color can be affected. Also, its fire-resistant properties can be reduced if the material is not properly maintained. NOTICE Using anything but recommended cleaners and procedures may affect the fabrics appearance and fire-resistant properties.

359,"Leather (if equipped) Feature of Seat Leather - Leather is made from the outer skin of an animal, which goes through a special process to be available for use. Since it is a natural object, each part differs in thickness or density. Wrinkles may appear as a natural result of stretching and shrinking depending on the temperature and humidity. - The seat is made of stretchable fabric to improve comfort. - The parts contacting the body are curved and the side supporting area is high which provides driving comfort and stability. - Wrinkles may appear naturally from usage. It is not a fault of the products. CAUTION Caring for the leather seats - Vacuum the seat periodically to remove dust and sand on the seat. It will prevent abrasion or damage of the leather and maintain its quality. - Wipe the natural leather seat cover often with dry or soft cloth. - Use of proper leather protective may prevent abrasion of the cover and helps maintain the color. Be sure to read the instructions and consult a specialist when using leather coating or protective agent. - Light colored (beige, cream beige) leather is easily contaminated and the stain is noticeable. Clean the seats frequently. - Avoid wiping with wet cloth. It may cause the surface to crack.  Wrinkles or abrasions which appear naturally from usage are not covered by warranty.  Belts with metallic accessories, zippers or keys inside the back pocket may damage the seat fabric.  Make sure not to wet the seat. It may change the nature of natural leather.  Jeans or clothes which could bleach may contaminate the surface of the seat covering fabric.

360," Cleaning the leather seats - Remove all contaminations instantly. Refer to instructions below for removal of each contaminant. - Cosmetic products (sunscreen, foundation, etc.) Apply cleansing cream on a cloth and wipe the contaminate spot. Wipe off the cream with a wet cloth and remove water with a dry cloth. - Beverages (coffee, soft drink, etc.) Apply a small amount of neutral detergent and wipe until contaminations do not smear. - Oil Remove oil instantly with absorbable cloth and wipe with stain remover used only for natural leather. - Chewing gum Harden the gum with ice and remove gradually. Cleaning the lap/shoulder belt webbing Clean the belt webbing with any mild soap solution recommended for cleaning upholstery or carpet. Follow the instructions provided with the soap. Do not bleach or re-dye the webbing because this may weaken it. Cleaning the interior window glass If the interior glass surfaces of the vehicle become fogged (that is, covered with an oily, greasy or waxy film), they should be cleaned with glass cleaner. Follow the directions on the glass cleaner container. NOTICE Do not scrape or scratch the inside of the rear window. This may result in damage to the rear window defroster grid.

361,"EMISSION CONTROL SYSTEM The emission control system of your vehicle is covered by a written limited warranty. Please see the warranty information contained in the Service Passport in your vehicle. Your vehicle is equipped with an emission control system to meet all emission regulations. There are three emission control systems which are as follows. (1) Crankcase emission control system (2) Evaporative emission control system (3) Exhaust emission control system In order to assure the proper function of the emission control systems, it is recommended that you have your car inspected and maintained by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer in accordance with the maintenance schedule in this manual. 1. Crankcase emission control system The positive crankcase ventilation system is employed to prevent air pollution caused by blow-by gases being emitted from the crankcase. This system supplies fresh filtered air to the crankcase through the air intake hose. Inside the crankcase, the fresh air mixes with blow-by gases, which then pass through the PCV valve into the induction system. 2. Evaporative emission control system The Evaporative Emission Control System is designed to prevent fuel vapors from escaping into the atmosphere. Canister Fuel vapors generated inside the fuel tank are absorbed and stored in the onboard canister. When the engine is running, the fuel vapors absorbed in the canister are drawn into the surge tank through the purge control solenoid valve. Purge Control Solenoid Valve (PCSV) The purge control solenoid valve is controlled by the Engine Control Module (ECM); when the engine coolant temperature is low during idling, the PCSV closes so that evaporated fuel is not taken into the engine. After the engine warms up during ordinary driving, the PCSV opens to introduce evaporated fuel to the engine. 
",,
362,"3. Exhaust emission control system The Exhaust Emission Control System is a highly effective system which controls exhaust emissions while maintaining good vehicle performance. Engine exhaust gas precautions (carbon monoxide) Carbon monoxide can be present with other exhaust fumes. Therefore, if you smell exhaust fumes of any kind inside your vehicle, have it inspected and repaired immediately. If you ever suspect exhaust fumes are coming into your vehicle, drive it only with all the windows fully open. Have your vehicle checked and repaired immediately. WARNING Exhaust Engine exhaust gases contain carbon monoxide (CO). Though colorless and odorless, it is dangerous and could be lethal if inhaled. Follow the instructions on this page to avoid CO poisoning.  Do not operate the engine in confined or closed areas (such as garages) any more than what is necessary to move the vehicle in or out of the area.  When the vehicle is stopped in an open area for more than a short time with the engine running, adjust the ventilation system (as needed) to draw outside air into the vehicle.  Never sit in a parked or stopped vehicle for any extended time with the engine running.  When the engine stalls or fails to start, excessive attempts to restart the engine may cause damage to the emission control system. 
",,
363,"Operating precautions for catalytic converters (if equipped) WARNING Fire A hot exhaust system can ignite flammable items under your vehicle. Do not park, idle, or drive the vehicle over or near flammable objects, such as grass, vegetation, paper, leaves, etc. The exhaust system and catalytic system are very hot while the engine is running or immediately after the engine is turned off. Keep away from the exhaust system and catalytic, you may get burned. Also, do not remove the heat sink around the exhaust system, do not seal the bottom of the vehicle or do not coat the vehicle for corrosion control. It may present a fire risk under certain conditions. Your vehicle is equipped with a catalytic converter emission control device. Therefore, the following precautions must be observed:  Use only UNLEADED FUEL for petrol engine.  Do not operate the vehicle when there are signs of engine malfunction, such as misfire or a noticeable loss of performance.  Do not misuse or abuse the engine. Examples of misuse are coasting with the ignition off and descending steep grades in gear with the ignition off.  Do not operate the engine at high idle speed for extended periods (5 minutes or more).  Do not modify or tamper with any part of the engine or emission control system. All inspections and adjustments must be made by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer.  Avoid driving with an extremely low fuel level. Running out of fuel could cause the engine to misfire, damaging the catalytic converter. Failure to observe these precautions could result in damage to the catalytic converter and to your vehicle. Additionally, such actions could void your warranties.

364,"Petrol particulate filter (GPF) (if equipped) Petrol Particulate Filter (GPF) systemremoves the soot in the exhaust gas.The GPF system automatically burns (or oxidizes) the accumulated soot in accordance with driving situations, unlike a disposable air filter. In other words, the accumulated soot is automatically purged out by the engine control system and by the high exhaust gas temperature at normal/ high driving speeds.However, when the vehicle is continually driven at repeated short distances or driven at low speed for a long time, the accumulated soot may not be automatically removed because of low exhaust gas temperature. In this case, the accumulated soot may reach a certain amount regardless of the soot oxidization process, then the GPF lamp ( ) will illuminate.The Petrol Particulate Filter (GPF)lamp stops illuminating, when the driving speed exceeds 80 km/h (50 mph) with engine RPM 1,500 - 4,000 and the gear in the 3rd position or above for approximately 30 minutes.When the GPF lamp starts to blink or the warning message Check exhaust system pops up even though the vehicle was driven as mentioned above, we recommend that you have the GPF system checked by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer.With GPF lamp blinking for an extended period of time, it may damage the GPF system and lower the fuel economy. CAUTION We recommend you to use only the regulated petrol fuels, when your vehicle is equipped with the GPF system.When you use other petrol fuels which contain unspecified additives, they may damage the GPF system and cause exhaust emission problems.

368,"CHARACTERISTICS OF CNG CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) is principally constituted by methane. CNG is considered as clean burning fuel. Due to low density of CNG, it is compressed at a pressure of around 200 bars to enhance the vehicle on-board storage capacity. Pure CNG has no colour and no smell. Some additives are added for smell in order to detect any gas leakage. Gaseous Propane is 1.5 times heavier and butane is 2 times heavier than air. Volume of CNG increases more than 250 times when changed to gas from liquid, so liquid state is easier for transportation and storage. It is economical because consumption of engine oil is lower and fuel cost is less than others. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS '26 In order to get the best out of CNG fuel, it is recommended that the engine must be turned and regularly serviced, both as regards the mechanical and the electrical parts in addition to the routine maintenance required by the vehicle manufacturer.  Please check fuel gauge on the cluster for petrol availability in fuel tank before you start the engine.  Check/replace CNG fuel filter every 30,000 kms. Clean at every service.  Always refer to HYUNDAI Owners manual for trouble shooting and Do It Yourself Maintenance.  In case of any accident, get the vehicle repaired through authorised HYUNDAI dealer workshop only.  For emergency handling of any CNG leakage, user must be aware of the location and operation of the Manual shut off valve.  CNG has a special odour to make it easier to detect leakages. In case of leakages, immediately close the shut off valve & contact HYUNDAI authorised dealer workshop for further assistance.  Ensure that while filling CNG in the tank, the supply should cut off automatically in and around 22 litre. If it does not cut off, do not try to fill more CNG.  In case of replacement of any component in CNG system, always contact HYUNDAI authorised dealer workshop.  It is safe to carry a fire extinguisher in your vehicle. Your CNG is equipped with a fire extinguisher placed under the front passengers seat.
