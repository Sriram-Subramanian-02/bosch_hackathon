1,"CAUTION: MODIFICATIONS TO YOUR HYUNDAI Your HYUNDAI should not be modified in any way. Such modifications may adversely affect the performance, safety or durability of your HYUNDAI and may, in addition, violate conditions of the limited warranties covering the vehicle. Certain modifications may also be in violation of regulations established by the Department of Transportation and other government agencies in your country. 7:2:$<5$',225&(//8/$5 TELEPHONE INSTALLATION Your vehicle is equipped with electronic fuel injection and other electronic components. It is possible for an improperly installed/adjusted two-way radio or cellular telephone to adversely affect electronic systems. For this reason, we recommend that you carefully follow the radio manufacturers instructions or consult your HYUNDAI dealer for precautionary measures or special instructions if you choose to install one of these devices. SAFETY AND VEHICLE DAMAGE WARNING This manual includes information titled as DANGER, WARNING, CAUTION and NOTICE. These titles indicate the following: DANGER DANGER indicates a hazardous situation which, if not avoided, will result in death or serious injury. WARNING WARNING indicates a hazardous situation which, if not avoided, could result in death or serious injury. CAUTION CAUTION indicates a hazardous situation which, if not avoided, could result in minor or moderate injury. NOTICE NOTICE indicates a situation which, if not avoided, could result in vehicle 
","<tab>The table contains an excerpt from a manual issued by Hyundai. The first row emphasizes the importance of avoiding modifications to the vehicle as they may impact performance, safety, and warranties. It also warns that certain alterations might violate transportation regulations. 

The second and third rows provide guidelines for telephone installation, specifically emphasizing the potential adverse effects on electronic systems. Hyundai recommends following the radio manufacturer's instructions carefully or consulting a dealer for guidance to mitigate these risks. 

The fourth row introduces the safety warnings present in the manual, categorizing them into four types: DANGER, WARNING, CAUTION, and NOTICE. The definitions of each category are provided, explaining the potential consequences of hazardous situations and the need to adhere to the warnings to prevent them. 

The final two rows seem to be an introduction or header to the information contained within the table, which appears to be an excerpt or summary of a more comprehensive manual.</tab>

","<tab>The table contains information that could be categorized into nine sections, ranging from warranty policies to emergency situations. The first row serves as the header, labeling each section. The subsequent rows seem to provide a hierarchical structure, indicating relationships between the sections. For instance, the second row indicates that the third and fourth sections are subcategories of the second section, entitled ""Vehicle Information."" 

The structure suggests a table of contents or a hierarchical organization of topics, starting with the main categories and potentially breaking down into subcategories. The depth of this hierarchy varies, with some main categories having multiple subsections, while others are more concise.

This table offers a glimpse of the content that could be expanded upon, providing an overview of the topics covered, like a table of contents in a manual or a comprehensive guide. The absence of detailed information for each section in this extracted data means that further clarification would be needed to ascertain the full scope and nature of the topics discussed.</tab>

6,"Use of MTBE HYUNDAI recommends avoiding fuels containing MTBE (Methyl T ertiary Butyl Ether) over 15.0% vol. (Oxygen Content 2.7% weight) in your vehicle. Fuel containing MTBE over 15.0% vol. (Oxygen Content 2.7% weight) may reduce vehicle performance and produce vapor lock or hard starting. NOTICE Y our New Vehicle Limited Warranty may not cover damage to the fuel system and any performance problems that are caused by the use of fuels containing methanol or fuels containing MTBE (Methyl T ertiary Butyl Ether) over 15.0% vol. (Oxygen Content 2.7% weight.) Do not use methanol Fuels containing methanol (wood alcohol) should not be used in your vehicle. This type of fuel can reduce vehicle performance and damage components of the fuel system, engine control system and emission control system. Fuel Additives HYUNDAI recommends that you use unleaded gasoline which has an octane rating of RON (Research Octane Number) 95/AKI (Anti Knock Index) 91/AKI (Anti-Knock Index) 87 or higher . For customers who do not use good quality gasolines, and have problems starting or the engine does not run smoothly , one bottle of additive added to the fuel tank is recommended according to the maintenance schedule (refer to the Normal Maintenance Schedule section in chapter 9). Additives are available from your authorized HYUNDAI dealer along with information on how to use them. Do not mix other additives. Operation in foreign countries If you are going to drive your vehicle in another country , be sure to:  Observe all regulations regarding registration and insurance.  Determine that acceptable fuel is available.

8,"VEHICLE BREAK-IN PROCESS By following a few simple precautions for the first 1,000 km (600 mi.) you may add to the performance, economy and life of your vehicle.  Do not race the engine.  While driving, avoid sudden acceleration.  Do not maintain a single speed for long periods of time, either fast or slow . Varying engine speed is needed to properly break-in the engine.  Avoid hard stops, except in emergencies, to allow the brakes to seat properly .  Do not tow a trailer during the first 2,000 km (1,200 mi.) of operation.  Fuel economy and engine performance may vary depending on vehicle break-in process and be stabilized after 6,000 km (4,000 mi.). New engines may consume more oil during the vehicle break-in period.

17,,"<tab>The table appears to be a checklist for a vehicle inspection or maintenance record. Each row corresponds to a different vehicle component or system, with each column representing an assessment or action related to that component. 

The first row contains the name of the services and the last row has labels for the columns. The cells include abbreviations, notes, and codes seemingly related to the condition of the vehicle's components or the tasks completed.

For instance, the second row indicates that the vehicle was placed on a lift for inspection, and various systems were checked, with notes on the condition of the steering gear, linkage, and boots. It also mentions requirements, such as ""I"" which appears in several columns, possibly indicating items that require attention or further investigation.

Some parts of the data seem to be encoded or use abbreviations that are not easily decipherable without additional context. The third row, for example, has a lengthy description in the third column, referring to a specific vehicle component and its status or requirements.

The rightmost columns seem to indicate the inspection status of various components, with labels like ""Done,"" ""Reqd"" (required), ""I"" (inspect), and others. The final two rows appear to be related to the assessment of additional items, with the last row focusing on the road test. 

Overall, the table provides a comprehensive record of a vehicle inspection, including the systems checked, their status, and any relevant observations or actions. However, some of the content is hard to decipher without further information on the meaning of the codes and abbreviations used.</tab>
<tab>The table appears to be a checklist for maintaining or inspecting a vehicle, likely a car. Each row represents a different component or system in the vehicle that requires attention. The columns indicate the status or requirements of each item.

The first row, for instance, suggests that the ""engine bay"" has been ""done,"" indicating an inspection or maintenance task completed. The second and third rows seem to refer to the vehicle's body and underbody conditions, with terms like ""floor,"" ""rocker panels,"" and ""rust."" These appear to be checked and recorded as either ""done"" or ""required"" (reqd.).

The fourth row mentions engine oil and filter, requiring attention or replacement, while the fifth row refers to the engine timing chain or belt, needing inspection and possible replacement. Row six focuses on the battery and its connections, and row seven addresses the brake system, mentioning brake pads and shoes.

Some entries describe inspections of specific systems, such as the eighth row checking spark plugs and the ninth row examining hoses related to vacuum, EGR, VGT, and WGT systems. The tenth row looks at the tensile strength of the engine and notes any fluid leaks. Tyre condition, including tread depth and pressure, is inspected, as seen in the eleventh row.

The twelfth row mentions wiper blades and washer fluids, which are to be replaced or refilled. Row thirteen shifts attention to the brake and clutch system, checking for free play and leakages. Several rows examine various components of the vehicle's drivetrain, including the transmission, differential, and drive shafts. Air filters and cooling systems are also inspected, as indicated in the fourteenth and fifteenth rows.

The final row appears to be a catch-all for any additional notes or observations about the vehicle's condition, with entries like ""check suspension"" and ""replace air filter."" Overall, the data suggests a thorough check of the vehicle's key systems and components, likely as part of a routine maintenance routine.

Unfortunately, the data contains many abbreviations and cryptic terms, making it challenging to decipher the exact nature of the vehicle's components and systems. Without additional context, some of the information is difficult to interpret.</tab>

","<tab>For optimal engine and powertrain performance, it's crucial to use the right lubricants and fluids in your vehicle. The table provides a comprehensive list of recommended lubricants, along with their respective volumes and classifications. 

Starting with the engine oil, it's advisable to use SAE 0W-20, API SN PLUS/SP, or ILSAC GF-6 engine oil for Smartstream G1.5 engines, requiring a drain and refill of 3.8 liters. The Smartstream G1.5 T-GDi engines, on the other hand, call for a different type of engine oil. The recommendation here is to use a higher grade, such as API SN PLUS or above, with a volume of 4.2 liters.

The manual transmission fluid is specified as API GL-4 and SAE 70W for the Smartstream G1.5, needing around 1.5 to 1.6 liters, while the Smartstream G1.5 T-GDi requires a similar specification of transmission fluid in slightly higher volume. 

For the dual-clutch transmission fluid, the recommendation is again API GL-4 and SAE 70W, with a volume range of 1.6 to 1.7 liters, exclusively for the Smartstream G1.5 T-GDi. IVT fluid, suitable for the Smartstream G1.5, should be SP-CVT1 or HYUNDAI Genuine SP-CVT1, with a volume of 6.7 liters.

Regarding coolant, the Smartstream G1.5 uses a mixture of antifreeze and distilled water, while the Smartstream G1.5 T-GDi has a slightly higher volume requirement. Both types of engines recommend using brake fluid that meets DOT-4 standards, with a volume of around 0.7 to 0.8 liters.

Lastly, the fuel tank has a capacity of approximately 45 liters. It's important to note that this is less than the actual size of the tank to prevent fuel leakage and accommodate vapor creation. Using the specified lubricants and fluids can help maintain optimal performance and fuel efficiency while ensuring the longevity of your vehicle's engine and powertrain components.</tab>

31,"Recommended SAE viscosity number NOTICE Always be sure to clean the area around any filler plug, drain plug, or dipstick before checking or draining any lubricant. This is especially important in dusty or sandy areas and when the vehicle is used on unpaved roads. Cleaning the plug and dipstick areas will prevent dirt and grit from entering the engine and other mechanisms that could be damaged. Never add any additives to the engine oil. Engine oil additives can change the properties of engine oil and may cause serious engine failure. Engine oil viscosity (thickness) has an effect on fuel economy and cold weather operating (engine start and engine oil flowability). Lower viscosity engine oils can provide better fuel economy and cold weather performance, however, higher viscosity engine oils are required for satisfactory lubrication in hot weather. Using oils of any viscosity other than those recommended could result in engine damage. When choosing an oil, consider the range of temperature your vehicle will be operated in before the next oil change. Proceed to select the recommended oil viscosity from the chart. Temperature Range for SAE Viscosity Numbers Temperature C -30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 40 50 (F) -10 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Smartstream G1.5 *1 0W-20 0W-20 Smartstream G1.5 T-GDi *2 0W-20 0W-20 *1 : Requires <API SN PLUS (or above) Full synthetic> grade engine oil. If a lower grade engine oil (mineral oil including Semi-synthetic) is used, then the engine oil and engine oil filter must be replaced as indicated severe maintenance condition. *2 : If a lower grade engine oil (Mineral oil including Semi-synthetic) is used, then the engine oil and engine oil filter must be replaced as indicated severe maintenance condition. An engine oil displaying this API Certification Mark conforms to the international Lubricant Specification Advisory Committee (ILSAC). It is recommended to only use engine oils that uphold this API Certification Mark. 
","<tab>The table provides information on recommended engine oil viscosity numbers for two types of engines, the Smartstream G1.5 and the Smartstream G1.5 T-GDi. The viscosity numbers are categorized into temperature ranges in degrees Celsius and Fahrenheit. For the Celsius scale, the temperatures range from -30 to 50 degrees, while the Fahrenheit scale runs from -10 to 120 degrees. 

The Smartstream G1.5 engine requires 0W-20 viscosity engine oil. This recommendation is consistent for temperatures spanning -30 to 50 degrees Celsius. As for the Smartstream G1.5 T-GDi engine, it also uses 0W-20 viscosity oil across the same temperature range. However, there are additional notes specifying the necessity of using a particular grade of engine oil and the potential need to replace the engine oil and filter under specific conditions.

The table serves as a guide to choosing the appropriate engine oil viscosity based on operating temperature. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining a clean engine area and avoiding the use of additives. The content also warns against the potential consequences of using incorrect viscosity oil, highlighting the need to follow recommendations for optimal engine performance and prevention of damage.</tab>

35,"IMPORTANT SAFETY PRECAUTIONS You will find many safety precautions and recommendations throughout this section, and throughout this manual. The safety precautions in this section are among the most important. Always wear your seat belt A seat belt is your best protection in all types of accidents. Airbags are designed to supplement seat belts, not replace them. So even though your vehicle is equipped with airbags, ALWAYS make sure you and your passengers wear your seat belts, and wear them properly. Restrain all children All children under age 13 should ride in your vehicle properly restrained in a rear seat, not the front seat. Infants and small children should be restrained in an appropriate Child Restraint System. Larger children should use a booster seat with the lap/shoulder belt until they can use the seat belt properly without a booster seat. Airbag hazards While airbags can save lives, they can also cause serious or fatal injuries to occupants who sit too close to them, or who are not properly restrained. Infants, young children, and short adults are at the greatest risk of being injured by an inflating airbag. Follow all instructions and warnings in this manual. Driver distraction Driver distraction presents a serious and potentially deadly danger, especially for inexperienced drivers. Safety should be the first concern when behind the wheel and drivers need to be aware of the wide array of potential distractions, such as drowsiness, reaching for objects, eating, personal grooming, other passengers, and using mobile phones. Drivers can become distracted when they take their eyes and attention off the road or their hands off the wheel to focus on activities other than driving. To reduce your risk of distraction and an accident:  ALWAYS set up your mobile devices (for example, MP3 players, phones, navigation units, etc.) when your vehicle is parked or safely stopped.  ONLY use your mobile device when allowed by laws and conditions permit safe use. NEVER text or email while driving. Most countries have laws prohibiting drivers from texting. Some countries and cities also prohibit drivers from using handheld phones.  NEVER let the use of a mobile device distract you from driving. You have a responsibility to your passengers and others on the road to always drive safely, with your hands on the wheel as well as your eyes and attention on the road. Control your speed Excessive speed is a major factor in crash injuries and deaths. Generally, the higher the speed, the greater the risk, but serious injuries can also occur at lower speeds. Never drive faster than is safe for current conditions, regardless of the maximum speed posted. Keep your vehicle in safe condition Having a tire blowout or a mechanical failure can be extremely hazardous. To reduce the possibility of such problems, check your tire pressures and condition frequently, and perform all regularly scheduled maintenance.

37,"Safety precautions Adjusting the seats so that you are sitting in a safe and comfortable position plays an important role for the safety of the driver and passengers, along with seat belts and airbags when in an accident. WARNING Do not use a cushion that reduces friction between the seat and the passenger. The passengers hips may slide under the lap portion of the seat belt during an accident or a sudden stop. Serious or fatal internal injuries could result because the seat belt cannot operate properly. Airbags You can take steps to reduce the risk of being injured by an inflating airbag. Sitting too close to an airbag greatly increases the risk of injury in the event the airbag inflates. Move your seat as far back as possible from front airbags, while still maintaining control of the vehicle. WARNING To reduce the risk of serious injury or death from an inflating airbag, take the following precautions: Adjust the drivers seat as far to the rear as possible maintaining the ability to control the vehicle. Adjust the front passenger seat as far to the rear as possible. Hold the steering wheel by the rim with hands at the 9 oclock and 3 oclock positions to minimize the risk of injuries to your hands and arms. NEVER place anything or anyone between you and the airbag. Do not allow the front passenger to place feet or legs on the dashboard to minimize the risk of leg injuries. Seat belts Always fasten your seat belt before starting any trip. At all times, passengers should sit upright and be properly restrained. Infants and small children must be restrained in appropriate Child Restraint Systems. Children who have outgrown a booster seat and adults must be restrained using the seat belts. WARNING Take the following precautions when adjusting your seat belt:  NEVER use one seat belt for more than one occupant.  Always position the seatback upright with the lap portion of the seat belt snug and low across the hips.  NEVER allow children or small infants, or pets to ride on a passengers lap.  Do not route the seat belt across your neck, across sharp edges, or reroute the shoulder strap away from your body.  Do not allow the seat belt to become caught or jammed. 
",,
38,"Front seats WARNING Take the following precautions when adjusting your seat: NEVER attempt to adjust the seat while the vehicle is moving. The seat could respond with unexpected movement and may cause loss of vehicle control resulting in an accident. Do not place anything under the front seats. Loose objects in the drivers foot area could interfere with the operation of the foot pedals, causing an accident. Do not allow anything to interfere with the normal position and proper locking of the seatback. Do not place a cigarette lighter on the floor or seat. When you operate the seat, gas may exit out of the lighter causing a fire. Use extreme caution when picking up small objects trapped under the seats or between the seat and the center console. Your hands might be cut or injured by the sharp edges of the seat mechanism. If there are occupants in the rear seats, be careful while adjusting the front seat position. Make sure that the seat is locked in place after the adjustment. If not, the seat might move unexpectedly resulting in an accident. CAUTION To prevent injury:  Do not adjust your seat while wearing your seat belt. Moving the seat cushion forward may cause strong pressure on your abdomen.  Do not allow your hands or fingers to get caught in the seat mechanisms while the seat is moving. WARNING NEVER allow children in the vehicle unattended. The power seats are operable when the vehicle is turned off. NOTICE To prevent damage to the power seats:  Always stop adjusting the seats when the seat has been adjusted as far forward or rearward as possible.  Do not adjust the seats longer than necessary when the vehicle is turned off. This may result in unnecessary battery drain.  Do not operate two or more seats at the same time. This may result in an electrical malfunction.

49,"SEAT BELTS This section describes how to use the seat belts properly. It also describes some of the things not to do when using seat belts. Seat belt safety precautions Always fasten your seat belt and make sure all passengers have fastened their seat belts before starting any trip. Airbags are designed to supplement the seat belt as an additional safety device, but they are not a substitute. Most countries require all occupants of a vehicle to wear seat belts. WARNING Seat belts must be used by ALL passengers whenever the vehicle is moving. Take the following precautions when adjusting and wearing seat belts: Children under the age of 13 should be properly restrained in the rear seats. Never allow children to ride in the front passenger seat, unless the airbag is deactivated. If a child is seated in the front passenger seat, move the seat as far back as possible. And the child must always be restrained in the seat properly. NEVER allow an infant or child to be carried on an occupants lap. NEVER ride with the seatback reclined when the vehicle is moving. Do not allow children to share a seat or seat belt. Do not wear the shoulder belt under your arm or behind your back.  Never wear a seat belt over fragile objects. If there is a sudden stop or impact, the seat belt can damage it.  Do not use the seat belt if it is twisted. A twisted seat belt will not protect you properly in an accident.  Do not use a seat belt if the webbing or hardware is damaged.  Do not latch the seat belt into the buckles of other seats.  NEVER unfasten the seat belt while driving. This may cause loss of vehicle control resulting in an accident.  Make sure there is nothing in the buckle interfering with the seat belt latch mechanism, because any materials in the buckle can cause the seat belt not to be fastened securely.  No modifications or additions should be made by the user which will either prevent the seat belt adjusting devices from operating to remove slack, or prevent the seat belt assembly from being adjusted to remove slack. WARNING Damaged seat belts and seat belt assemblies will not operate properly. Always replace:  Frayed, contaminated, or damaged webbing.  Damaged hardware.  The entire seat belt assembly after it has been worn in an accident, even if damage to webbing or assembly is not apparent.

A loose or twisted seat belt will not protect you properly in an accident. Do not place anything near the buckle. This may adversely affect the buckle and cause it to function improperly. Always replace your pretensioner after activation or an accident. NEVER inspect, service, repair or replace the pretensioner by yourself. We recommend that you have the pretensioner inspected, serviced, repaired or replaced by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer. Do not hit the seat belt assemblies. WARNING Do not touch the pretensioner seat belt assemblies for several minutes after they have been activated. When the pretensioner seat belt mechanism deploys during a collision, the pre- tensioner can become hot and can burn you. CAUTION Body work on the front area of the vehicle may damage the pretensioner seat belt system. Therefore, we recommend the system to be serviced by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer. OBN7I033057 OBN7I033057 Your vehicle is equipped with drivers and front passengers pretensioner seat belts (Retractor pretensioner). The purpose of the pretensioner is to make sure the seat belts fit tightly against the occupants body in certain frontal or side collision(s). The pretensioner seat belts may be activated in crashes where the frontal or side collision(s) is severe enough, together with the airbags. When the vehicle stops suddenly, or if the occupant tries to lean forward too quickly, the seat belt retractor will lock into position. In certain frontal collisions, the pre- tensioner will activate and pull the seat belt into tighter contact against the occupants body. If the system senses excessive tension on the driver or passengers seat belt when the pretensioner system activates, the load limiter inside the retractor pretensioner will release some of the pressure on the affected seat belt (if equipped with load limiter).

56,"Seat belt use and children Infant and small children Most countries have Child Restraint System laws which require children to travel in approved Child Restraint System devices, including booster seats. The age at which seat belts can be used instead of Child Restraint System differs among countries, so you should be aware of the specific requirements in your country, and where you are travelling. Infant and Child Restraint System must be properly placed and installed in a rear seat. For more information refer to the Child Restraint Systems section in this chapter. WARNING ALWAYS properly restrain infants and small children in a Child Restraint System appropriate for the childs height and weight. To reduce the risk of serious injury or death to a child and other passengers, NEVER hold a child in your lap or arms when the vehicle is moving. The violent forces created during an accident will tear the child from your arms and throw the child against the interior of the vehicle. Small children are best protected from injury in an accident when properly restrained in the rear seat by a Child Restraint System that meets the requirements of the Safety Standards of your country. Before buying any Child Restraint System, make sure that it has a label certifying that it meets Safety Standard of your country. The Child Restraint System must be appropriate for your childs height and weight. Check the label on the Child Restraint System for this information. Refer to the Child Restraint Systems section in this chapter. Larger children Children under age 13 and who are too large for a booster seat should always occupy the rear seat and use the available lap/shoulder belts. A seat belt should lie across the upper thighs and be snug across the shoulder and chest to restrain the child safely. Check belt fit periodically. A childs squirming could put the belt out of position. In the event of an accident, children are afforded the best safety restrained by a proper Child Restraint System in the rear seats. If a larger child over age 13 must be seated in the front seat, the child must be securely restrained by the available lap/shoulder belt and the seat should be placed in the rearmost position. If the shoulder belt portion slightly touches the childs neck or face, try placing the child closer to the center of the vehicle. If the shoulder belt still touches their face or neck, they need to be returned to an appropriate booster seat in the rear seat. WARNING  Always make sure larger childrens seat belts are worn and properly adjusted.  NEVER allow the shoulder belt to contact the childs neck or face.  Do not allow more than one child to use a single seat belt. Seat belt use and injured people A seat belt should be used when an injured person is being transported.

57,"Care of seat belts Seat belt systems should never be disassembled or modified. In addition, care should be taken to assure that seat belts and belt hardware are not damaged by seat hinges, doors or other abuse. Periodic inspection All seat belts should be inspected periodically for wear or damage of any kind. Any damaged parts should be replaced as soon as possible. Keep belts clean and dry Seat belts should be kept clean and dry. If belts become dirty, they can be cleaned by using a mild soap solution and warm water. Bleach, dye, strong detergents or abrasives should not be used because they may damage and weaken the fabric. When to replace seat belts The entire seat belt assembly or assemblies should be replaced if the vehicle has been involved in an accident. This should be done even if no damage is visible. We recommend that you consult an authorized HYUNDAI dealer. One person per belt Two people (including children) should never attempt to use a single seat belt. This could increase the severity of injuries in case of an accident. Do not lie down Sitting in a reclined position when the vehicle is in motion can be dangerous. Even when buckled up, the protections of your restraint system (seat belts and/ or airbags) is greatly reduced by reclining your seatback. Seat belts must be snug against your hips and chest to work properly. During an accident, you could be thrown into the seat belt, causing neck or other injuries. The more the seat back is reclined, the greater the chance for the passengers hips to slide under the lap belt or the passengers neck to strike the shoulder belt. WARNING  NEVER ride with a reclined seatback when the vehicle is moving.  Riding with a reclined seatback increases your chance of serious or fatal injuries in the event of a collision or sudden stop.  Driver and passengers should always sit well back in their seats, with the seatbacks upright and should be belted properly.

59,"Rearward-facing Child Restraint System OBN7I033028 OBN7I033028 A rearward-facing Child Restraint System provides restraint with the seating surface against the back of the child. The harness system holds the child in place, and in an accident, acts to keep the child positioned in the Child Restraint Systems and reduce the stress to the fragile neck and spinal cord. All children under the age of one year must always ride in a rearward-facing Child Restraint System. There are different types of rearward-facing Child Restraint Systems: infant-only Child Restraint Systems can only be used rearward-facing. Convertible and 3-in-1 Child Restraint Systems typically have higher height and weight limits for the rearward-facing position, allowing you to keep your child rearward-facing for a longer period of time. Keep using Child Restraint Systems in the rearward-facing position as long as children fit within the height and weight limits allowed by the Child Restraint Systems manufacturer. Forward-facing Child Restraint System OBN7I033029 OBN7I033029 A forward-facing Child Restraint System provides restraint for the childs body with a harness. Keep children in a forward-facing Child Restraint System with a harness until they reach the top height or weight limit allowed by your Child Restraint Systems manufacturer. Once your child outgrows the forward- facing Child Restraint System, your child is ready for a booster seat. Booster seats A booster seat is a Child Restraint System designed to improve the fit of the vehicles seat belt system. A booster seat positions the seat belt so that it fits properly over the stronger parts of your childs body. Keep your children in booster seats until they are big enough to fit in a seat belt properly. For a seat belt to fit properly, the lap belt must lie comfortable across the upper thighs, not the stomach. The shoulder belt should lie comfortable across the shoulder and chest and not across the neck or face.

For these airbags to provide protection, the seat belts must be worn at all times when driving. You can be severely injured or killed in an accident if you are not wearing a seat belt. Airbags are designed to supplement seat belts, but do not replace them. Also, airbags are not designed to deploy in every collision. In some accidents, the seat belts are the only restraint protecting you. WARNING AIRBAG SAFETY PRECAUTIONS ALWAYS use seat belts and Child Restraint Systems - every trip, every time, everyone! Even with airbags, you can be seriously injured or killed in a collision if you are improperly belted or not wearing your seat belt when the airbag inflates. NEVER place a child in any Child Restraint System or booster seat in the front passenger seat, unless the airbag is deactivated. An inflating airbag could forcefully strike the infant or child causing serious or fatal injuries. ABC - Always Buckle Children under age 13 in the back seat. It is the safest place for children of any age to ride. If a child age 13 or older must be seated in the front seat, he or she must be properly belted and the seat should be moved as far back as possible. All occupants should sit upright with the seatback in an upright position, centered on the seat cushion with their seat belt on, legs comfortably extended and their feet on the floor until the vehicle is parked and the vehicle is turned off. If an occupant is out of position during an accident, the rapidly deploying airbag may forcefully contact the occupant causing serious or fatal injuries. You and your passengers should never sit or lean unnecessarily close to the airbags or lean against the door or center console.

73,"During a moderate to severe frontal collision, sensors will detect the vehicles rapid deceleration. If the rate of deceleration is high enough, the control unit will inflate the front airbags, at the time and with the force needed. The front airbags help protect the driver and front passenger by responding to frontal impacts in which seat belts alone cannot provide adequate restraint. When needed, the side airbags help provide protection in the event of a side impact by supporting the side upper body area. Airbags are activated (able to inflate if necessary) when the ignition switch is in the ON position or about with in 3 minutes after ignition off. Airbags inflate in the event of certain frontal or side collisions to help protect the occupants from serious physical injury. There is no single speed at which the airbags will inflate. Generally, airbags are designed to inflate based upon the severity of a collision and its direction. These two factors determine whether the sensors produce an electronic deployment/inflation signal. Airbag deployment depends on a number of factors including vehicle speed, angles of impact and the density and stiffness of the vehicles or objects which your vehicle impacts during a collision. The determining factors are not limited to those mentioned above. The front airbags will completely inflate and deflate in an instant. It is virtually impossible for you to see the airbags inflate during an accident. It is much more likely that you will simply see the deflated airbags hanging out of their storage compartments after the collision.  To help provide protection, the airbags must inflate rapidly. The speed of airbag inflation is a consequence of extremely short time in which to inflate the airbag between the occupant and the vehicle structures before the occupant impacts those structures. This speed of inflation reduces the risk of serious or lifethreatening injuries and is thus a necessary part of airbag design. However, the rapid airbag inflation can also cause injuries which can include facial abrasions, bruises and broken bones because the inflation speed also causes the airbags to expand with a great deal of force.  There are even circumstances under which contact with the airbag can cause fatal injuries, especially if the occupant is positioned excessively close to the airbag. You can take steps to reduce the risk of being injured by an inflating airbag. The greatest risk is sitting too close to the airbag. An airbag needs space to inflate. It is recommended that the driver leave as much space as possible between their chest and the center of the steering wheel, while still being able to maintain control of the vehicle.

75,"What to expect after an airbag inflates After a frontal or side airbag inflates, it will deflate very quickly. Airbag inflation will not prevent the driver from seeing out of the windshield or being able to steer. Curtain airbags may remain partially inflated for some time after they deploy. WARNING After an airbag inflates, take the following precautions: Open your windows and doors as soon as possible after impact to reduce prolonged exposure to the smoke and powder released by the inflating airbag. Do not touch the airbag storage areas internal components immediately after an airbag has inflated. The parts that come into contact with an inflating airbag may be very hot. Always wash exposed skin areas thoroughly with cold water and mild soap. We recommend that an authorized HYUNDAI dealer replace the airbag immediately after deployment. Airbags are designed to be used only once. Noise and smoke from inflating airbag When the airbags inflate, they make a loud noise and may produce smoke and powder in the air inside of the vehicle. This is normal and is a result of the ignition of the airbag inflator. After the airbag inflates, you may feel substantial discomfort in breathing because of the contact of your chest with both the seat belt and the airbag, as well as from breathing the smoke and powder. The powder may aggravate asthma for some people. If you experience breathing problems after an airbag deployment, seek medical attention immediately. Though the smoke and powder are nontoxic, they may cause irritation to the skin, eyes, nose, throat, etc. If this is the case, wash and rinse with cold water immediately and seek medical attention if the symptoms persist.

Why didnt my airbag go off in a collision? There are certain types of accidents in which the airbag would not be expected to provide additional protection. These include rear impacts, second or third collisions in multiple impact accidents, as well as low speed impacts. Damage to the vehicle indicates a collision energy absorption, and is not an indicator of whether or not an airbag should have inflated. Airbag collision sensors WARNING To reduce the risk of an airbag deploying unexpectedly and causing serious injury or death:  Do not hit or allow any objects to impact the locations where airbags or sensors are installed.  Do not perform maintenance on or around the airbag sensors. If the location or angle of the sensors is altered, the airbags may deploy when they should not or may not deploy when they should.  Installing bumper guards with non- genuine Hyundai or non-equivalent parts may adversely affect the collision and airbag deployment performance. To ensure correct function of the airbag system we recommend to replace the bumper with genuine Hyundai part or the equivalent (of the genuine part) specified for your vehicle.  Place the ignition switch to the LOCK/ OFF or ACC position and wait for 3 minutes when the vehicle is being towed to prevent inadvertent airbag deployment.  We recommend that all airbag repairs performed by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer.

81,"SRS care The SRS is virtually maintenance-free and there are no parts you can safely service by yourself. If the SRS airbag warning light does not illuminate when the ignition switch is in the ON position, or continuously remains on, we recommend that the system be immediately inspected by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer. We recommend any work on the SRS system, such as removing, installing, repairing, or any work on the steering wheel, the front passengers panel, front seats and roof rails be performed by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer. Improper handling of the SRS system may result in serious personal injury. WARNING To reduce the risk of serious injury or death take the following precautions:  Do not attempt to modify or disconnect the SRS components or wiring, including the addition of any kind of badges to the pad covers or modifications to the body structure.  Do not place objects over or near the airbag modules on the steering wheel, instrument panel, and the front passengers panel above the glove box.  Clean the airbag pad covers with a soft cloth moistened with plain water. Solvents or cleaners could adversely affect the airbag covers and proper deployment of the system.  We recommend that inflated airbags replaced by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer.  If components of the airbag system must be discarded, or if the vehicle must be scrapped, certain safety precautions must be observed. We recommend that you consult an authorized HYUNDAI dealer for the necessary information. Failure to follow these precautions could increase the risk of personal injury.

152,"STEERING WHEEL MDPS (Motor Driven Power Steering) The system assists you with steering the vehicle. If the vehicle is turned off or if the power steering system becomes inoperative, you may still steer the vehicle, but it will require increased steering effort. If you notice any change in the effort required to steer during normal vehicle operation, we recommend that you have the system inspected by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer. CAUTION If Motor Driven Power Steering does not operate normally, the warning light and the message Check motor driven power steering will illuminate on the instrument cluster. You may steer the vehicle, but it will require increased steering efforts. We recommend that you take your vehicle to an authorized HYUNDAI dealer or to a service station and have the system inspected as soon as possible. Information During normal vehicle operation:  The steering effort may be high immediately after placing the ignition switch to the ON position. This happens as the system performs the MDPS system diagnostics. When the diagnostics are completed, the steering wheel effort will return to its normal condition.  When the battery voltage is low, you might have to put more steering effort. However, it is a temporary condition so that it will return to normal condition after charging the battery.  A click noise may be heard from the MDPS relay after the ignition switch is in the ON or LOCK/OFF position.  Motor noise may be heard when the vehicle is at a stop or at a low driving speed.  When you operate the steering wheel in low temperatures, abnormal noise may occur. If the temperature rises, the noise will disappear. This is a normal condition.  When an error is detected from MDPS, the steering effort assist function will not be activated in order to prevent fatal accidents. The instrument cluster warning lights may be on or the steering effort may be high. If these symptoms occur, drive the vehicle to a safe area as soon as it is safe to do so. We recommend that you have the system inspected by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer as soon as possible.

WARNING Automotive fuel is highly flammable and explosive. Failure to follow these guidelines may result in SERIOUS INJURY or DEATH: Read and follow all warnings posted at the gas station. Before refueling, note the location of the Emergency Fuel Shut-Off, if available, at the gas station. Before touching the fuel nozzle, you should eliminate the potential build- up of static electricity by touching a metal part of the vehicle, a safe distance away from the fuel filler neck, nozzle, or other gas source, with your bare hand. Do not use mobile phones while refueling. Electric current and/or electronic interference from cellular phones can potentially ignite fuel vapors and cause a fire. Do not get back into a vehicle once you have begun refueling. You can generate a buildup of static electricity by touching, rubbing or sliding against any item or fabric capable of producing static electricity. Static electricity discharge can ignite fuel vapors causing a fire. If you must re-enter the vehicle, you should once again eliminate potentially dangerous static electricity discharge by touching a metal part of the vehicle, away from the fuel filler neck, nozzle or other fuel source, with your bare hand.  When using an approved portable fuel container, be sure to place the container on the ground prior to refueling. Static electricity discharge from the container can ignite fuel vapors causing a fire. Once refueling has begun, contact between your bare hand and the vehicle should be maintained until the filling is complete.  Use only approved portable plastic fuel containers designed to carry and store fuel.  When refueling, always shift the gear to the P (Park, for IVT/dual clutch transmission) or first gear or R (Reverse, for manual transmission) set the parking brake, and place the ignition switch to the LOCK/ OFF position. Sparks produced by electrical components related to the engine can ignite fuel vapors causing a fire.  Do not use matches or a lighter and do not smoke or leave a lit cigarette in your vehicle while at a gas station, especially during refueling.  Do not over-fill or top-off your vehicle tank, which can cause fuel spillage.  If a fire breaks out during refueling, leave the vicinity of the vehicle, and immediately contact the manager of the gas station and then contact the local fire department. Follow any safety instructions they provide.

","<tab>The table details how the headlight beam level of a vehicle should be adjusted according to different loading conditions. The beam leveling switch has four positions, labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3, which correspond to varying load scenarios. 

Position 0 is recommended when the vehicle has a driver only or a driver with a front passenger. For maximum visibility, the headlights should be set to their highest level in these situations. Position 1 is suggested when the car is carrying full passengers, including the driver. This setting lowers the headlight beam to account for the increased weight and ensures the safety of other road users. 

If the vehicle is carrying a full load of passengers and additional luggage, the switch should be moved to position 2 to further lower the headlight beam. Finally, position 3 is appropriate when the vehicle has a driver and maximum permissible loading in the rear. This is the lowest setting, ensuring that the headlights do not dazzle other drivers.

227,"AM (MW, LW) reception OJF045309L OJF045309L AM broadcasts can be received at greater distances than FM broadcasts. This is because AM radio waves are transmitted at low frequencies. These long distance, low frequency radio waves can follow the curvature of the earth rather than travelling straight out into the atmosphere. In addition, they curve around obstructions so that they can provide better signal coverage. FM radio station OJF045310L OJF045310L FM broadcasts are transmitted at high frequencies and do not bend to follow the earths surface. Because of this, FM broadcasts generally begin to fade at short distances from the station. Also, FM signals are easily affected by buildings, mountains, or other obstructions. These can result in undesirable or unpleasant listening conditions that may lead you to believe a problem exists with your radio. The following conditions are normal and do not indicate radio trouble : JBM004 JBM004  Fading - As your vehicle moves away from the radio station, the signal will weaken and sound will begin to fade. When this occurs, we suggest that you select another stronger station. 
",,"<img file_path=(image_Next_Gen_Verna_227_1.jpx)>The image depicts the difference in transmission range of AM and FM radio waves. AM radio waves are transmitted at low frequencies and have a longer range, able to follow the curvature of the earth and bend around obstacles. This allows for a stronger signal coverage. Conversely, FM radio waves are transmitted at high frequencies, and therefore have a shorter range because they travel straight out and are easily affected by obstacles. The image shows two cars, one in close proximity to the radio station (AM) and the other farther away (FM). This illustrates the concept of the longer transmission range of AM radio waves.

The signal is being received by a car and a building. The car is driving away from the tower with a question mark indicating that the signal is fading. Mountains and a bridge are shown as obstructions in the path of the radio signals. The image suggests that AM signals can travel farther than FM signals and are less susceptible to obstructions. This is because AM radio waves are transmitted at low frequencies, which can bend around the curvature of the Earth. On the other hand, FM signals are transmitted at high frequencies and are more easily affected by buildings, mountains, and other obstructions. This can lead to fading and poor reception.

The text accompanying the image explains that this fading of the radio signal is a normal occurrence as a vehicle moves away from the transmitting station and is not a sign of radio trouble. The text also states that AM radio broadcasts can be received at greater distances than FM broadcasts because AM radio waves travel at low frequencies and can follow the curvature of the earth.

228,"Using a cellular phone or a twoway radio When a cellular phone is used inside the vehicle, noise may be produced from the audio system. This does not mean that something is wrong with the audio equipment. In such a case, use the cellular phone at a place as far as possible from the audio equipment. NOTICE When using a communication system such as a cellular phone or a radio set inside the vehicle, a separate external antenna must be fitted. When a cellular phone or a radio set is used with an internal antenna alone, it may interfere with the vehicles electrical system and adversely affect safe operation of the vehicle. WARNING Do not use a cellular phone while driving. Stop at a safe location to use a cellular phone.  Flutter/Static - Weak FM signals or large obstructions between the transmitter and your radio can disturb the signal causing static or fluttering noises to occur. Reducing the treble level may lessen this effect until the disturbance clears. OJF045311L OJF045311L  Station Swapping - As a FM signal weakens, another more powerful signal near the same frequency may begin to play. This is because your radio is designed to lock onto the clearest signal. If this occurs, select another station with a stronger signal.  Multi-Path Cancellation - Radio signals being received from several directions can cause distortion or fluttering. This can be caused by a direct and reflected signal from the same station, or by signals from two stations with close frequencies. If this occurs, select another station until the condition has passed. 
",,"<img file_path=(image_Next_Gen_Verna_228_1.jpx)>The image depicts a car driving on a road with two radio towers on either side of it. The car is receiving signals from both towers, which are broadcasting at slightly different frequencies (88.1 Mhz and 88.3 Mhz). The signal from the tower on the left side of the image is being reflected off of the ground, causing the signal to reach the car from multiple directions. This phenomenon, known as multi-path cancellation, can cause distortion or fluttering in the audio. To avoid this, the car's radio will try to lock onto the strongest signal, which in this case is the signal from the tower on the right side of the image.  As the car moves further away from the tower on the left, the signal from the tower on the right will become stronger, and the multi-path cancellation effect will lessen.

245,"NOTICE To prevent unnecessary wear or damage to the clutch: Do not rest your foot on the clutch pedal while driving. Do not hold the vehicle with the clutch on an incline, while waiting for the traffic light, etc. Always depress the clutch pedal down fully to prevent noise or damage. Do not start with the 2nd (second) gear engaged except when you start on a slippery road. Depress the clutch pedal all the way and be careful not to depress the pedal again before returning to the upright position after you release the pedal. If you depress the pedal before returning to the original position repeatedly, it may cause the clutch system failure. Do not overload the vehicle. Starting or driving a vehicle in this situation generates too much frictional heat to the clutch disk which might cause damage to the clutch cover and disk. When starting the vehicle or driving backwards, releasing the clutch pedal too soon after shifting the lever might turn off the engine and lead to an accident. Downshifting Downshift when you must slow down in heavy traffic or drive up a steep hill to prevent engine load. Also, downshifting reduces the chance of stalling and can accelerate when you need to increase your speed again. When the vehicle is going downhill, downshifting helps maintain safe speed by providing brake power from the engine and enables less wear on the brakes. NOTICE To prevent damage to the engine, clutch and transmission:  When downshifting from 5th gear to 4th gear, be careful not to inadvertently push the shift lever sideways engaging the 2nd gear. A drastic downshift may cause the engine speed to increase to the point the tachometer will enter the red- zone.  Do not downshift more than two gear at a time or downshift the gear when the engine is running at high speed (5,000 RPM or higher). Such a downshifting may damage the engine, clutch and the transmission.

246,"Good driving practices Never take the vehicle out of gear and coast down a hill. This is extremely dangerous. Dont ride the brakes. This can cause the brakes and related parts to overheat and malfunction. When you are driving down a long hill, slow down and shift to a lower gear. Engine braking will help slow down the vehicle. Slow down before shifting to a lower gear. This will help avoid over-revving the engine, which can cause damage. Slow down when you encounter cross winds. This gives you much better control of your vehicle. Be sure the vehicle is completely stopped before you shift into R (Reverse) to prevent damage to the transmission. Exercise extreme caution when driving on a slippery surface. Be especially careful when braking, accelerating or shifting gears. On a slippery surface, an abrupt change in vehicle speed can cause the drive wheels to lose traction and may cause loss of vehicle control resulting in an accident. WARNING Do not use the engine brake (shifting from a higher gear to lower gear) rapidly on slippery roads. The vehicle may slip causing an accident. WARNING To reduce the risk of SERIOUS INJURY or DEATH:  ALWAYS wear your seatbelt. In a collision, an unbelted occupant is significantly more likely to be seriously injured or killed than a properly belted occupant.  Avoid high speeds when cornering or turning.  Do not make quick steering wheel movements, such as sharp lane changes or fast, sharp turns.  The risk of rollover is greatly increased if you lose control of your vehicle at highway speeds.  Loss of control often occurs if two or more wheels drop off the roadway and the driver over steers to reenter the roadway.  In the event your vehicle leaves the roadway, do not steer sharply. Instead, slow down before pulling back into the travel lanes.  HYUNDAI recommends you follow all posted speed limits.

253,"Good driving practices Never move the shift lever from P (Park) or N (Neutral) to any other position with the accelerator pedal depressed. Never move the shift lever into P (Park) when the vehicle is moving. Completely stop before shifting into R (Reverse) or D (Drive). Be sure the vehicle is completely stopped before you attempt to shift into R (Reverse) or D (Drive). Do not move the shift lever to N (Neutral) when driving. Doing so may result in an accident because of a loss of engine braking and the transmission could be damaged. Never attempt to select a gear that is opposite the direction of the vehicle motion. Check the gear position before driving. Stop the vehicle before shifting to the desired gear. The vehicle may turn off, causing a collision. Do not drive with your foot resting on the brake pedal. Even light, but consistent pedal pressure can result in the brakes overheating, brake wear and possibly even brake failure. Always apply the parking brake when leaving the vehicle. Do not depend on placing the transmission in P (Park) to keep the vehicle from moving. Exercise extreme caution when driving on a slippery surface. Be especially careful when braking, accelerating, or shifting gears. On a slippery surface, an abrupt change in vehicle speed can cause the drive wheels to lose traction and may cause loss of vehicle control resulting in an accident. Optimum vehicle performance and economy is obtained by smoothly depressing and releasing the accelerator pedal.  When the message Trans cooled. Resume driving appears you can continue to drive your vehicle.  When possible, drive the vehicle smoothly. If any of the warning messages in the cluster display continue to blink, for your safety, we recommend that you contact an authorized HYUNDAI dealer and have the system inspected.

254," WARNING To reduce the risk of SERIOUS INJURY or DEATH:  ALWAYS wear your seat belt. In a collision, an unbelted occupant is significantly more likely to be seriously injured or killed than a properly belted occupant.  Avoid high speeds when cornering or turning.  Do not make quick steering wheel movements, such as sharp lane changes or fast, sharp turns.  The risk of rollover is greatly increased if you lose control of your vehicle at highway speeds.  Loss of control often occurs if two or more wheels drop off the roadway and the driver over steers to reenter the roadway.  In the event your vehicle leaves the roadway, do not steer sharply. Instead, slow down before pulling back into the travel lanes.  HYUNDAI recommends you follow all posted speed limits.

Press the shift button whilst moving the shift lever. The shift lever can freely operate. Dual clutch transmission operation The dual clutch transmission has seven forward speeds and one reverse speed. The individual speeds are selected automatically when the shift lever is in the D (Drive) position.  The dual clutch transmission can be thought of as an automatically shifting manual transmission. It gives the driving feel of a manual transmission, yet provides the ease of a fully automatic transmission.  When D (Drive) is selected, the transmission will automatically shift through the gears similar to a conventional automatic transmission. Unlike a traditional automatic transmission, the gear shifting can sometimes be felt and heard as the actuators engage the clutches and the gears are selected.

"
256," The dual clutch transmission incorporates a dry-type dual clutch mechanism, which allows for better acceleration performance and increased fuel economy whilst driving. But it differs from a conventional automatic transmission because it does not incorporate a torque converter. Instead, the transition from one gear to the next is managed by clutch slip, especially at lower speeds. As a result, shifts are sometimes more noticeable, and a light vibration can be felt as the transmission shaft speed is matched with the engine shaft speed. This is a normal condition of the dual clutch transmission. The dry-type clutch transfers torque more directly and provides a direct- drive feeling which may feel different from a conventional automatic transmission. This may be more noticeable when launching the vehicle from a stop or when travelling at low, stop-and-go vehicle speeds. When rapidly accelerating from a lower vehicle speed, the engine RPM may increase dramatically as a result of clutch slip as the dual clutch transmission selects the correct gear. This is a normal condition. When accelerating from a stop on an incline, press the accelerator smoothly and gradually to avoid any shudder feeling or jerkiness. When travelling at a lower vehicle speed, if you release the accelerator pedal quickly, you may feel engine braking before the transmission changes gears. This engine braking feeling is similar to operating a manual transmission at low speed. When driving downhill, you may wish to move the gear shift lever to Manual Shift mode and downshift to a lower gear in order to control your speed without using the brake pedal excessively.  When you turn the engine on and off, you may hear clicking sounds as the system goes through a self-test. This is a normal sound for the dual clutch transmission.  During the first 1,500 km, you may feel that the vehicle is not smooth when accelerating at low speed. During this break-in period, the shift quality and performance of your new vehicle is continuously optimised. WARNING To reduce the risk of serious injury or death:  ALWAYS check the surrounding areas near your vehicle for people, especially children, before shifting a vehicle into D (Drive) or R (Reverse).  Before leaving the drivers seat, always make sure the shift lever is in the P (Park) position, then set the parking brake, and place the ignition switch in the LOCK/OFF position. Unexpected and sudden vehicle movement can occur if these precautions are not followed.  Do not use aggressive engine braking (shifting from a higher gear to a lower gear) on slippery roads. This could cause the tires to slip and may result in an accident. NOTICE  Always come to a complete stop before shifting into D (Drive) or R (Reverse).  Do not put the shift lever in N (Neutral) whilst driving.

263,"BRAKING SYSTEM Power-assist brakes Your vehicle has power-assisted brakes that adjust automatically through normal usage. If the engine is not running or is turned off while driving, the power assist for the brakes will not work. You can still stop your vehicle by applying greater force to the brake pedal than typical. The stopping distance, however, will be longer than with power brakes. When the engine is not running, the reserve brake power is partially depleted each time the brake pedal is applied. Do not pump the brake pedal when the power assist has been interrupted. Pump the brake pedal only when necessary to maintain steering control on slippery surfaces. Information When the brake pedal is depressed under certain driving conditions or weather conditions, you may temporarily hear a noise. This is normal and does not indicate a problem with your brakes. While driving on a road with deicing chemicals, brake noise or abnormal tire wear may occur due to deicing chemicals. In a safe traffic condition, additionally apply the brakes to remove deicing chemicals on the brake discs and pads. WARNING Take the following precautions: Do not drive with your foot resting on the brake pedal. This will create abnormal high brake temperatures, excessive brake lining and pad wear, and increased stopping distances.  When descending down a long or steep hill, downshift to a lower gear in order to control your speed without using the brake pedal excessively. Applying the brakes continuously will cause the brakes to overheat and could result in a temporary loss of braking performance.  Wet brakes may impair the vehicle's ability to safely slow down; the vehicle may also pull to one side when the brakes are applied. Applying the brakes lightly will indicate whether they have been affected in this way. Always test your brakes in this fashion after driving through deep water. To dry the brakes, lightly tap the brake pedal to heat up the brakes while maintaining a safe forward speed until brake performance returns to normal. Avoid driving at high speeds until the brakes function correctly. Disc brakes wear indicator When your brake pads are worn and new pads are required, you will hear a high pitched warning sound from your front or rear brakes. You may hear this sound come and go or it may occur whenever you depress the brake pedal. Please remember some driving conditions or climates may cause a brake squeal when you first apply (or lightly apply) the brakes. This is normal and does not indicate a problem with your brakes.

273,"Using ABS To obtain the maximum benefit from your ABS in an emergency situation, do not attempt to modulate your brake pressure and do not try to pump your brakes. Depress your brake pedal as hard as possible. When you apply your brakes under conditions which may lock the wheels, you may hear sounds from the brakes, or feel a corresponding sensation in the brake pedal. This is normal and it means your ABS is active. ABS does not reduce the time or distance it takes to stop the vehicle. Always maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of you. ABS will not prevent a skid that results from sudden changes in direction, such as trying to take a corner too fast or making a sudden lane change. Always drive at a safe speed for the road and weather conditions. ABS cannot prevent a loss of stability. Always steer moderately when braking hard. Severe or sharp steering wheel movement can still cause your vehicle to veer into oncoming traffic or off the road. On loose or uneven road surfaces, operation of the anti-lock brake system may result in a longer stopping distance than for vehicles equipped with a conventional brake system. The ABS ( ) warning light will stay on for several seconds after the ignition switch is in the ON position. During that time, ABS will go through self-diagnosis and the light will go off if everything is normal. If the light stays on, you may have a problem with your ABS. We recommend that you contact an authorized HYUNDAI dealer as soon as possible. WARNING If the ABS ( ) warning light is on and stays on, you may have a problem with the ABS. Your power brakes will work normally. To reduce the risk of serious injury or death, we recommend you to contact the nearest authorized HYUNDAI dealer as soon as possible. NOTICE When you drive on a road having poor traction, such as an icy road, and apply your brakes continuously, ABS will be active continuously and the ABS ( ) warning light may illuminate. Pull your vehicle over to a safe place and turn the vehicle off. Restart the vehicle. If the ABS warning light is off, then your ABS system is normal. Otherwise, you may have a problem with your ABS system. We recommend that you contact an authorized HYUNDAI dealer as soon as possible.

279,"Good braking practices WARNING Whenever leaving the vehicle or parking, always come to a complete stop and continue to depress the brake pedal. Shift the gear to the P (Park) position, then apply the parking brake, and place the ignition switch to the OFF position. Vehicles parked with the parking brake not applied or not fully engaged may roll inadvertently and may cause injury to the driver and others. ALWAYS apply the parking brake before exiting the vehicle. Wet brakes can be dangerous! The brakes may get wet if the vehicle is driven through standing water or if it is washed. Your vehicle will not stop as quickly if the brakes are wet. Wet brakes may cause the vehicle to pull to one side. To dry the brakes, apply the brakes lightly until the braking action returns to normal. If the braking action does not return to normal, stop as soon as it is safe to do so and we recommend that you call an authorized HYUNDAI dealer for assistance. DO NOT drive with your foot resting on the brake pedal. Even light, but constant pedal pressure can result in the brakes overheating, brake wear, and possibly even brake failure. If a tire goes flat while you are driving, apply the brakes gently and keep the vehicle pointed straight ahead while you slow down. When you are moving slowly enough for it to be safe to do so, pull off the road and stop in a safe location. Keep your foot firmly on the brake pedal when the vehicle is stopped to prevent the vehicle from rolling forward. System off  Brake Assist System is cancelled in the following situations: - The accelerator pedal is depressed over a certain level. - The vehicle stops. - ESC (Electronic Stability Control) or electronic devices has malfunctioned. - In a situation the system cannot operate normally. - Ten seconds have passed since the brake has been controlled automatically by The brake Assist System. WARNING  The brake Assist System decreases vehicle speed after a collision and reduces the risk of a second collision, but it does not prevent a second collision. You may drive away from the collision spot to avoid other dangerous situations by depressing the accelerator pedal.  After the vehicle is stopped by the brake Assist System, the system stops controlling the brakes. Depending on the situation, the driver should depress the brake or the accelerator pedal to prevent a further accident.

289,"63(&,$/'5,9,1*&21',7,216 Hazardous driving conditions When hazardous driving elements are encountered such as water, snow, ice, mud and sand, take the following precautions: Drive cautiously and maintain a longer braking distance. Avoid abrupt braking or steering. When your vehicle is stuck in snow, mud, or sand, use second gear. Accelerate slowly to avoid unnecessary wheel spin. Put sand, rock salt, tire chains or other non-slip materials under the wheels to provide additional traction while the vehicle becomes stuck in ice, snow, or mud. WARNING Downshifting with an IVT/dual clutch transmission while driving on slippery surfaces can cause an accident. The sudden change in tire speed could cause the tires to skid. Be careful when downshifting on slippery surfaces. Rocking the vehicle If it is necessary to rock the vehicle to free it from snow, sand, or mud, first turn the steering wheel right and left to clear the area around your front wheels. Then, shift back and forth between R (Reverse) and a forward gear. Try to avoid spinning the wheels, and do not race the engine. To prevent transmission wear, wait until the wheels stop spinning before shifting gears. Release the accelerator pedal while shifting, and press lightly on the accelerator pedal while the transmission is in gear. Slowly spinning the wheels in forward and reverse directions causes a rocking motion that may free the vehicle. WARNING If the vehicle is stuck and excessive wheel spin occurs, the temperature in the tires can increase very quickly. If the tires become damaged, a tire blow out or tire explosion can occur. This condition is dangerous - you and others may be injured. Do not attempt this procedure if people or objects are anywhere near the vehicle. If you attempt to free the vehicle, the vehicle can overheat quickly, possibly causing an engine compartment fire or other damage. Try to avoid spinning the wheels as much as possible to prevent overheating of either the tires or the engine. DO NOT allow the vehicle to spin the wheels above 56 km/h (35 mph). Information The ESC system must be turned OFF before rocking the vehicle. 
",,
290,"NOTICE If you are still stuck after rocking the vehicle a few times, have the vehicle pulled out by a tow vehicle to avoid engine overheating, possible damage to the transmission, and tire damage. For more information, refer to the Towing section in chapter 8. Smooth cornering Avoid braking or gear changing in corners, especially when roads are wet. Ideally, cornering should be taken under gentle acceleration. Driving at night Night driving presents more hazards than driving in the daylight. Here are some important tips to remember: Slow down and keep more distance between you and other vehicles, as it may be more difficult to see at night, especially in areas where there may not be any street lights. Adjust your mirrors to reduce the glare from other drivers headlights. Keep your headlights clean and properly aimed. Dirty or improperly aimed headlights will make it much more difficult to see at night. Avoid staring directly at the headlights of oncoming vehicles. You could be temporarily blinded, and it will take several seconds for your eyes to readjust to the darkness. Driving in the rain Rain and wet roads can make driving dangerous. When driving in the rain or on slick pavement:  Slow down and allow extra following distance. A heavy rainfall makes it harder to see and increases the distance needed to stop your vehicle.  Turn OFF your Smart Cruise Control. (if equipped)  Replace your windshield wiper blades when they show signs of streaking or missing areas on the windshield.  Make sure your tires have enough tread. If your tires do not have enough tread, making a quick stop on wet pavement may cause a skid and possibly lead to a collision. Refer to the Tire Replacement section in chapter 9.  Turn on your headlights to make it easier for others to see you. Using your headlights when using your windshield wipers is required in some jurisdictions.  Driving too fast through large puddles may affect your brakes. If you must go through puddles, try to drive through them slowly.  If you believe your brakes are wet, apply them several times while the vehicle is moving slowly. Hydroplaning If the road is wet enough and you are going fast enough, your vehicle may have little or no contact with the road surface and actually ride on the water. The best advice is SLOW DOWN when the road is wet. The risk of hydroplaning increases as the depth of tire tread decreases. 
",,
291,"Driving in flooded areas Avoid driving through flooded areas unless you are sure the water is not deeper than the bottom of the wheel hub. If you are not sure, turn around and find a different route. Drive through any water slowly. Allow adequate stopping distance because the brake performance can be reduced. After driving through water, dry the brakes by gently applying them several times while the vehicle is moving slowly. Highway driving Tires Adjust the tire inflation pressure, as specified. Under-inflation may overheat or damage the tires. Do not install worn-out or damaged tires, which may reduce traction or fail. Information Never over-inflate your tires above the maximum inflation pressure, as specified on your tires. Fuel, engine coolant and engine oil Driving at higher speeds on the highway consumes more fuel and is less efficient than driving at a slower, more moderate speed. Maintain a moderate speed in order to conserve fuel when driving on the highway. Be sure to check both the engine coolant level and the engine oil before driving. Drive belt A loose or damaged drive belt may overheat the engine.

292,"WINTER DRIVING The severe weather conditions of winter quickly wear out tires and cause other problems. To minimize winter driving problems, you should take the following suggestions: Snow or icy conditions You need to keep sufficient distance between your vehicle and the vehicle in front of you. Apply the brakes gently. Speeding, rapid acceleration, sudden brake applications, and sharp turns are potentially very hazardous practices. During deceleration, use engine braking to the fullest extent. Sudden brake applications on snowy or icy roads may cause the vehicle to skid. To drive your vehicle in deep snow, it may be necessary to use snow tires or to install tire chains on your tires. Always carry emergency equipment. Some of the items you may want to carry include tire chains, tow straps or chains, a flashlight, emergency flares, sand, a shovel, jumper cables, a window scraper, gloves, ground cloth, coveralls, a blanket, etc. Snow tires WARNING Snow tires should be equivalent in size and type to the vehicles standard tires. Otherwise, the safety and handling of your vehicle may be adversely affected. We recommend that you use snow tires when road temperature is below 7C (45F). Refer to the below chart, and mount the recommended snow tire for your vehicle. If you mount snow tires on your vehicle, make sure to use the same Inflation pressure as the original tires. Mount snow tires on all four wheels to balance your vehicles handling in all weather conditions. The traction provided by snow tires on dry roads may not be as high as your vehicles original equipment tires. Check with the tire dealer for maximum speed recommendations. Tire chains OBN7I063032 OBN7I063032 Since the sidewalls of radial tires are thinner than other types of tires, they may be damaged by mounting some types of tire chains on them. Therefore, the use of snow tires is recommended instead of tire chains. If tire chains must be used, use genuine HYUNDAI Parts or the equivalent specified for your vehicle and install the tire chain after reviewing the instructions provided with the tire chains. Damage to your vehicle caused by improper tire chain use is not covered by your vehicle manufacturers warranty. 
",,"<img file_path=(image_Next_Gen_Verna_292_1.jpeg)>The image shows a close-up of a car tire with snow chains installed. The chains are a type of traction device that is used to improve a vehicle's grip on snow and ice. The chains are made of metal and are wrapped around the tire. They are typically used in winter driving conditions to help prevent the vehicle from slipping or sliding. The chains can also help to improve braking performance. The text mentions that tire chains should only be used on radial tires with caution as the sidewalls are thinner. The text also recommends using snow tires instead of chains when possible.

"
293,"NOTICE When using tire chains: Wrong size chains or improperly installed chains can damage your vehicles brake lines, suspension, body and wheels. If you hear noise caused by chains contacting the body, retighten the chain to prevent contact with the vehicle body. To prevent body damage, retighten the chains after driving 0.5-1.0 km (0.3-0.6 mi.). Do not use tire chains on vehicles equipped with aluminum wheels. If unavoidable, use a wire type chain. Use wire chains less than 15 mm (0.59 in.) wide to prevent damage to the chains connection. WARNING The use of tire chains may adversely affect vehicle handling: Drive less than 30 km/h (20 mph) or the chain manufacturers recommended speed limit, whichever is lower. Drive carefully and avoid bumps, holes, sharp turns, and other road hazards, which may cause the vehicle to bounce. Avoid sharp turns or locked wheel braking. Information Install tire chains only in pairs and on the front tires. It should be noted that installing tire chains on the tires will provide a greater driving force, but will not prevent side skids. Do not install studded tires without first checking local and municipal regulations for possible restrictions against their use. Chain Installation When installing tire chains, follow the manufacturers instructions and mount them as tightly possible. Drive slowly (less than 30 km/h (20 mph)) with chains installed. If you hear the chains contacting the body or chassis, stop and tighten them. If they still make contact, slow down until the noise stops. Remove the tire chains as soon as you begin driving on cleared roads. When mounting snow chains, park the vehicle on level ground away from traffic. Turn on the vehicle Hazard Warning Flasher and place a triangular emergency warning device behind the vehicle (if available). Always place the vehicle in P (Park), apply the parking brake and turn off the engine before installing snow chains.

294,"Winter precautions Use high quality ethylene glycol coolant Your vehicle is delivered with high quality ethylene glycol coolant in the cooling system. It is the only type of coolant that should be used because it helps prevent corrosion in the cooling system, lubricates the water pump and prevents freezing. Be sure to replace or replenish your coolant in accordance with the maintenance schedule in chapter 9. Before winter, have your coolant tested to assure that its freezing point is sufficient for the temperatures anticipated during the winter. Check battery and cables Winter temperatures affect battery performance. Inspect the battery and cables, as specified in chapter 9. We recommend the battery charging cables be inspected by contact an authorized HYUNDAI or in a service station. Change to winter weight oil if necessary In some regions during winter, it is recommended to use the winter weight oil with lower viscosity In addition, replace the engine oil and filter if it is close to the next maintenance interval. Fresh engine oil ensures optimum engine operation during the winter months. For further information, refer to the chapter 2. When you are not sure about a type of winter weight oil, we recommend that you consult an authorized HYUNDAI dealer. Check spark plugs and ignition system Inspect the spark plugs, as specified in chapter 8. If necessary, replace them. Also check all ignition wirings and components for any cracks, wear-out, and damage. To prevent locks from freezing Spray approved de-icing fluid or glycerin into key holes. When a lock opening is already covered with ice, spray approved de-icing fluid over the ice to remove it. When an internal part of a lock freezes, try to thaw it with a heated key. Carefully use the heated key to avoid an injury. Use approved window washer anti- freeze solution Add window washer anti-freeze solution, as specified on the window washer container. Window washer anti-freeze solution is available from an authorized HYUNDAI dealer, and most vehicle accessory outlets. Do not use engine coolant or other types of anti-freeze solution, to prevent any damage to the vehicle paint.

295,"Do not let your parking brake freeze Under some conditions, your parking brake may freeze in the engaged position. This is most likely to happen when there is an accumulation of snow or ice around or near the rear brakes or the brakes are wet. When there is the risk that your parking brake may freeze: temporarily apply the parking brake with the gear in P (Park), then block the rear wheels, and then release the parking brake. Do not let ice and snow accumulate underneath Under some conditions, snow and ice may build up under the fenders and interfere with the steering. When driving in such conditions during the severe winter, check underneath the vehicle on a regular basis, to make sure that the front wheels and the steering components are not blocked. Carry emergency equipment In accordance with weather conditions, carry appropriate emergency equipment, while driving. Some of the items you may want to carry include tire chains, tow straps or chains, flashlight, emergency flares, sand, shovel, jumper cables, window scraper, gloves, ground cloth, coveralls, blanket, etc. Do not place objects or materials in the engine compartment Putting objects or materials in the engine compartment may cause an engine failure or combustion, because they may block the engine cooling. Such damage is not be covered by the manufacturers warranty. Drive your vehicle when water vapor condenses and accumulates inside the exhaust pipes When the vehicle is stopped for a long time in winter while the engine is running, water vapor may condense and accumulate inside the exhaust pipes.

When activated, the system uses these sensors to detect objects in front of the vehicle and issue warnings based on their proximity.  The system is triggered when the car shifts from reverse to drive, when the parking safety button is illuminated, or when the automatic parking distance warning setting is enabled.  Depending on the distance between the car and the object, the system issues audible warnings through a buzzer, ranging from intermittent beeps at 60-100cm, to more frequent beeps at 30-60cm, and a continuous beep within 30cm.  The image visualizes how the Forward Parking Distance Warning system uses these ultrasonic sensors to create a safety perimeter around the vehicle, alerting the driver to potential obstacles.

405,"Tire pressure monitoring system WARNING Over-inflation or under-inflation can reduce tire life, adversely affect vehicle handling, and lead to sudden tire failure that may cause loss of vehicle control resulting in an accident. Each tire, including the spare (if provided), should be inspected monthly when cold and inflated to the inflation pressure recommended by the vehicle manufacturer on the vehicle placard or tire inflation pressure label. (If your vehicle has tires of a different size than the size indicated on the vehicle placard or tire inflation pressure label, you should determine the proper tire inflation pressure for those tires.) As an added safety feature, your vehicle has been equipped with a tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) that illuminates a low tire pressure telltale when one or more of your tires is significantly under-inflated. Accordingly, when the low tire pressure telltale illuminates, you should stop and check your tires as soon as possible, and inflate them to the proper pressure. Driving on a significantly under-inflated tire causes the tire to overheat and can lead to tire failure. Under-inflation also reduces fuel efficiency and tire tread life, and may affect the vehicles handling and stopping ability. Please note that the TPMS is not a substitute for proper tire maintenance, and it is the drivers responsibility to maintain correct tire pressure, even if under-inflation has not reached the level to trigger illumination of the TPMS low tire pressure telltale. Your vehicle has also been equipped with a TPMS malfunction indicator to indicate when the system is not operating properly. The TPMS malfunction indicator is combined with the low tire pressure telltale. When the system detects a malfunction, the telltale will flash for about one minute and then remain continuously illuminated. This sequence will continue upon subsequent vehicle start-ups as long as the malfunction exists. When the malfunction indicator is illuminated, the system may not be able to detect or signal low tire pressure as intended. TPMS malfunctions may occur for a variety of reasons, including the installation of replacement or alternate tires or wheels on the vehicle that prevent the TPMS from functioning properly. Always check the TPMS malfunction telltale after replacing one or more tires or wheels on your vehicle to ensure that the replacement or alternate tires and wheels allow the TPMS to continue to function properly. NOTICE If any of the below happens, we recommend that you have the system inspected by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer. 1. The Low Tire Pressure Telltale/ TPMS Malfunction Indicator does not illuminate for 3 seconds when the ignition switch is moved to the ON position or when the engine is running. 2. The TPMS Malfunction Indicator remains illuminated after blinking for about 1 minute. 3. The Low Tire Pressure Position Telltale remains illuminated.

The Low Tire Pressure Position Telltale will indicate which tire is significantly underinflated by illuminating the corresponding position light. If either telltale illuminates, immediately reduce your speed, avoid hard cornering and anticipate increased stopping distances. You should stop and check your tires as soon as possible. Inflate the tires to the proper pressure as indicated on the vehicles placard or tire inflation pressure label located on the drivers side center pillar outer panel. If you cannot reach a service station or if the tire cannot hold the newly added air, replace the low pressure tire with the spare tire. The Low Tire Pressure Telltale will remain on and the TPMS Malfunction Indicator may blink for one minute and then remain illuminated (when the vehicle is driven about 10 minutes at speed above 25 km/h (15.5 mph)) until you have the low pressure tire repaired and replaced on the vehicle. CAUTION In winter or cold weather, the Low Tire Pressure Telltale may be illuminated if the tire pressure was adjusted to the recommended tire inflation pressure in warm weather. It does not mean your TPMS is malfunctioning because the decreased temperature leads to a proportional lowering of tire pressure. When you drive your vehicle from a warm area to a cold area or from a cold area to a warm area, or the outside temperature is greatly higher or lower, you should check the tire inflation pressure and adjust the tires to the recommended tire inflation pressure. WARNING Low pressure damage Significantly low tire pressure makes the vehicle unstable and can contribute to loss of vehicle control and increased braking distances. Continued driving on low pressure tires can cause the tires to overheat and fail. WARNING Do not connect another vehicles Tire Mobility Kit (TMK) to the power outlet.

When the low pressure tire or the flat tire is replaced with the spare tire, the Low Tire Pressure Telltale will remain on. Also, the TPMS Malfunction Indicator will illuminate after blinking for one minute if the vehicle is driven at speed above 25 km/h (15.5 mph) for about 10 minutes. Once the original wheel equipped with a tire pressure monitoring sensor is reinflated to the recommended pressure and reinstalled on the vehicle, the Low Tire Pressure Telltale and TPMS Malfunction Indicator will go off within a few minutes of driving. 
",,
408,"If the indicators do not extinguish after a few minutes, it is recommended to contact the nearest authorized HYUNDAI dealer. Each wheel is equipped with a tire pressure sensor mounted inside the tire behind the valve stem (except for the spare tire). You must use TPMS specific wheels. It is recommended that you always have your tires serviced by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer. You may not be able to identify a tire with low pressure by simply looking at it. Always use a good quality tire pressure gauge to measure. Please note that a tire that is hot (from being driven) will have a higher pressure measurement than a tire that is cold. A cold tire means the vehicle has been sitting for 3 hours and driven for less than 1.6 km (1 mi.) in that 3 hour period. Allow the tire to cool before measuring the inflation pressure. Always be sure the tire is cold before inflating to the recommended pressure. WARNING The TPMS cannot alert you to severe and sudden tire damage caused by external factors such as nails or road debris. If you feel any vehicle instability, immediately take your foot off the accelerator, apply the brakes gradually with light force, and slowly move to a safe position off the road. WARNING Tampering with, modifying, or disabling the Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) components may interfere with the systems ability to warn the driver of low tire pressure conditions and/or TPMS malfunctions. Tampering with, modifying, or disabling the Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) components may void the warranty for that portion of the vehicle. WARNING  Do not modify the vehicle; it may interfere with the TPMS function.  The wheels on the market do not have a TPMS sensor. For your safety, we recommend that you use parts for replacement from an authorized HYUNDAI dealer.  If you use the wheels on the market, use a TPMS sensor approved by a HYUNDAI dealer or the equivalent approved for your vehicle. If your vehicle is not equipped with a TPMS sensor or TPMS does not work properly, you may fail the periodic vehicle inspection conducted in your country.

414,"Use of compact spare tires (if equipped) Compact spare tires are designed for emergency use only. Drive carefully on the compact spare tire and always follow the safety precautions. WARNING To prevent compact spare tire failure and loss of control possibly resulting in an accident: Use the compact spare tire only in an emergency. NEVER operate your vehicle over 80 km/h (50 mph). Do not exceed the vehicles maximum load rating or the load carrying capacity shown on the sidewall of the compact spare tire. Do not use the compact spare tire continuously. Repair or replace the original tire as soon as possible to avoid failure of the compact spare tire. When driving with the compact spare tire mounted to your vehicle: Check the tire pressure after installing the compact spare tire. The compact spare tire should be inflated to 420 kPa (60 psi). Do not take this vehicle through an automatic car wash while the compact spare tire is installed. Do not use the compact spare tire on any other vehicle because this tire has been designed especially for your vehicle. The compact spare tires tread life is shorter than a regular tire. Inspect your compact spare tire regularly and replace worn compact spare tires with the same size and design, mounted on the same wheel. Do not use more than one compact spare tire at a time. Do not tow a trailer while the compact spare tire is installed. Information When the original tire and wheel are repaired and reinstalled on the vehicle, the wheel nuts torque must be set correctly. The correct wheel nut tightening torque is 11~13 kgf.m (79~94 lbf.ft). NOTICE To prevent damaging the compact spare tire and your vehicle:  Drive slowly enough for the road conditions to avoid all hazards, such as a potholes or debris.  Avoid driving over obstacles. The compact spare tire diameter is smaller than the diameter of a conventional tire and reduces the ground clearance about 25 mm (1 in.).  Do not use tire chains on the compact spare tire. Because of the smaller size, a tire chain will not fit properly.  Do not use the compact spare tire on any other wheels, nor should standard tires, snow tires, wheel covers or trim rings be used with the compact spare wheel.

443,"Recommended coolant When adding coolant, use only deionized water, distilled water or soft water for your vehicle and never mix hard water in the coolant filled at the factory. An incorrect coolant mixture can result in severe malfunction or engine damage. The engine in your vehicle has aluminum engine parts and must be protected by an phosphate-based ethylene glycol coolant to prevent corrosion and freezing. Do not use alcohol or methanol coolant or mix them with the specified coolant. Do not use a solution that contains more than 60% antifreeze or less than 35% antifreeze, which would reduce the effectiveness of the solution. For mixing percentage, refer to the following table: Information If in doubt about the mix ratio, a 50% water and 50% antifreeze mix is the easiest to mix together as it will be the same quantity of each. It is suitable to use for most temperature ranges of -35C (-31F) and higher. Changing coolant We recommend that coolant be changed by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer according to the Maintenance Schedule at the beginning of this chapter. WARNING Do not use engine coolant or antifreeze in the washer fluid reservoir. Engine coolant can severely obscure visibility when sprayed on the windshield and may cause loss of vehicle control resulting in an accident. Engine coolant may also cause damage to paint and body trim.

456,"Check tire inflation pressure Check your tires, including the spare tire, once a month or more. How to check Use a good quality tire pressure gauge to check tire pressure. You can not tell if your tires are properly inflated simply by looking at them. Radial tires may look properly inflated when they are under- inflated. Remove the valve cap from the tire valve stem. Press the tire gauge firmly onto the valve to get a pressure measurement. If the cold tire inflation pressure matches the recommended pressure on the tire and loading information label, no further adjustment is necessary. If the pressure is low, add air until you reach the recommended pressure. Make sure to put the valve caps back on the valve stems. Without the valve cap, dirt or moisture could get into the valve core and cause air leakage. If a valve cap is missing, install a new one as soon as possible. If you overfill the tire, release air by pushing on the metal stem in the center of the tire valve. Recheck the tire pressure with the tire gauge. Be sure to put the valve caps back on the valve stems. Without the valve cap, dirt or moisture could get into the valve core and cause air leakage. If a valve cap is missing, install a new one as soon as possible. WARNING  Recommended pressures must be maintained for the best ride, vehicle handling, and minimum tire wear.  Over-inflation or under-inflation can reduce tire life, adversely affect vehicle handling, and lead to sudden tire failure that may result in loss of vehicle control resulting in a collision.  Severe under-inflation may lead to severe heat build-up, causing blowouts, tread separation, and other tire failures that result in loss of vehicle control resulting in a collision. This risk is much higher on hot days and when driving for a long time at high speeds.  Under-inflation may cause excessive wear, poor handling, and reduced fuel economy. Wheel deformation is also possible. Keep your tire pressures at the proper levels. If a tire frequently needs refilling, have it inspected by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer.  Over-inflation produces a harsh ride, excessive wear at the center of the tire tread, and a greater possibility of damage from road hazards. 
",,
457,"Tire rotation To equalize tread wear, HYUNDAI recommends that the tires be rotated according to the maintenance schedule or sooner if irregular wear develops. During rotation, check the tires for correct balance. When rotating tires, check for uneven wear and damage. Abnormal wear is usually caused by incorrect tire pressure, improper wheel alignment, out-of- balance wheels, severe braking or severe cornering. Look for bumps or bulges in the tread or side of the tire. Replace the tire if you find any of these conditions. Replace the tire if fabric or cord is visible. After rotation, be sure to bring the front and rear tire pressures to specification and check wheel nut tightness (proper torque is 11~13 kgf.m [79~94 lbf.ft]). 6%/$$ 6%/$$ Disc brake pads should be inspected for wear whenever tires are rotated. Information The outside and inside of the unsymmetrical tire is distinguishable. When installing an unsymmetrical tire, be sure to install the side marked outside face the outside. If the side marked inside is installed on the outside, it will have a negative effect on vehicle performance. WARNING  Do not use the compact spare tire for tire rotation.  Do not mix bias ply and radial ply tires under any circumstances. This may cause unusual handling characteristics that may cause loss of vehicle control resulting in an collision. 
",,
458,"Wheel alignment and tire balance The wheels on your vehicle were aligned and balanced carefully at the factory to give you the longest tire life and best overall performance. In most cases, you will not need to have your wheels aligned again. However, if you notice unusual tire wear or your vehicle pulling one way or the other, the alignment may need to be reset. If you notice your vehicle vibrating when driving on a smooth road, your wheels may need to be rebalanced. NOTICE Only use approved wheel weights or your vehicles aluminum wheels may be damaged. Tire replacement ONE1092048N ONE1092048N [A]: Tread wear indicator If the tire is worn evenly, a tread wear indicator will appear as a solid band across the tread. This shows there is less than 1.6 mm (1/16 in.) of tread left on the tire. Replace the tire when this happens. Do not wait for the band to appear across the entire tread before replacing the tire. WARNING To reduce the risk of DEATH or SERIOUS INJURY:  Replace tires that are worn, show uneven wear, or are damaged. Worn tires can cause loss of braking effectiveness, steering control, and traction.  Always replace tires with the same size as each tire that was originally supplied with this vehicle. Using tires and wheels other than the recommended sizes could cause unusual handling characteristics, poor vehicle control, or negatively affect your vehicles Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS) resulting in a serious accident.  When replacing tires (or wheels), it is recommended to replace the two front or two rear tires (or wheels) as a pair. Replacing just one tire can seriously affect your vehicles handling.  Tires degrade over time, even when they are not being used. Regardless of the remaining tread, HYUNDAI recommends that tires be replaced after six (6) years of normal service.  Heat caused by hot climates or frequent high loading conditions can accelerate the aging process. Failure to follow this warning may cause sudden tire failure, which could lead to a loss of vehicle control resulting in an accident.

459,"Wheel replacement When replacing the metal wheels for any reason, make sure the new wheels are equivalent to the original factory units in diameter, rim width, and offset. Tire traction Tire traction can be reduced if you drive on worn tires, tires that are improperly inflated or on slippery road surfaces. Tires should be replaced when tread wear indicators appear. To reduce the possibility of losing control, slow down whenever there is rain, snow or ice on the road. Tire maintenance In addition to proper inflation, correct wheel alignment helps to decrease tire wear. If you find a tire is worn unevenly, have your dealer check the wheel alignment. When you have new tires installed, make sure they are balanced. This will increase vehicle ride comfort and tire life. Additionally, a tire should always be rebalanced if it is removed from the wheel. Compact spare tire replacement (if equipped) A compact spare tire has a shorter tread life than a regular size tire. Replace it when you can see the tread wear indicator bars on the tire. The replacement compact spare tire should be the same size and design tire as the one provided with your new vehicle and should be mounted on the same compact spare tire wheel. The compact spare tire is not designed to be mounted on a regular size wheel, and the compact spare tire wheel is not designed for mounting a regular size tire. WARNING The original tire should be repaired or replaced as soon as possible to avoid failure of the spare and loss of vehicle control resulting in an accident. The compact spare tire is for emergency use only. Do not operate your vehicle over 80 km/h (50 mph) when using the compact spare tire.

The speed rating is part of the tire size designation on the sidewall of the tire. This symbol corresponds to that tires designed maximum safe operating speed. 4. Tire ply composition and material The number of layers or plies of rubber-coated fabric in the tire. Tire manufacturers also must indicate the materials in the tire, which include steel, nylon, polyester, and others. The letter R means radial ply construction; the letter D means diagonal or bias ply construction; and the letter B means belted-bias ply construction. 5. Maximum permissible inflation pressure This number is the greatest amount of air pressure that should be put in the tire. Do not exceed the maximum permissible inflation pressure. Refer to the Tire and Loading Information label for recommended inflation pressure. 6. Maximum load rating This number indicates the maximum load in kilograms and pounds that can be carried by the tire. When replacing the tires on the vehicle, always use a tire that has the same load rating as the factory installed tire. 3. Checking tire life (TIN : Tire Identification Number) Any tires that are over six years old, based on the manufacturing date, (including the spare tire) should be replaced by new ones. You can find the manufacturing date on the tire sidewall (possibly on the inside of the wheel), displaying the DOT Code. The DOT Code is a series of numbers on a tire consisting of numbers and English letters. The manufacturing date is designated by the last four digits (characters) of the DOT code. DOT : XXXX XXXX OOOO The front part of the DOT shows a plant code number, tire size and tread pattern and the last four numbers indicate week and year manufactured. For example: DOT XXXX XXXX 1523 represents that the tire was produced in the 15th week of 2023. Speed Rating Symbol Maximum Speed 180 km/h (112 mph) 190 km/h (118 mph) 210 km/h (130 mph) 240 km/h (149 mph) 270 km/h (168 mph) 300 km/h (186 mph) 
","<tab>The table provides a list of speed rating symbols and their corresponding maximum speeds, specifically for passenger vehicle tires. These ratings are part of the tire size designation and indicate the safe operating speeds of the tires. The ratings range from S, which allows for a maximum speed of 180 km/h (112 mph), to Y, which permits a top speed of 300 km/h (186 mph). The speeds are mentioned in both metric and imperial units. Understanding these ratings can help drivers ensure they are operating their vehicles within the safe limits set by the tire manufacturer. 

This information is crucial as it directly impacts road safety and adhering to these limits can help prevent accidents and ensure the tire's longevity. Manufacturers use these ratings to indicate the tires' capabilities and help drivers make informed decisions when replacing their tires. Knowing the speed rating symbols and their associated maximum speeds is essential for compliance with traffic laws and maintaining vehicle safety.</tab>

462,"Uniform tire quality grading Quality grades can be found where applicable on the tire sidewall between tread shoulder and maximum section width. For example: TREADWEAR 200 TRACTION AA TEMPERATURE A Tread wear The tread wear grade is a comparative rating based on the wear rate of the tire when tested under controlled conditions on a specified government test course. For example, a tire graded 150 would wear one-and-a-half times (1) as well on the government course as a tire graded 100. The relative performance of tires depends upon the actual conditions of their use, however, and may depart significantly from the norm due to variations in driving habits, service practices and differences in road characteristics and climate. These grades are molded on the sidewalls of passenger vehicle tires. The tires available as standard or optional equipment on your vehicle may vary with respect to grade. Traction - AA, A, B & C The traction grades, from highest to lowest, are AA, A, B and C. Those grades represent the tires ability to stop on wet pavement as measured under controlled conditions on specified government test surfaces of asphalt and concrete. A tire marked C may have poor traction performance. WARNING The traction grade assigned to this tire is based on straight ahead braking traction tests, and does not include acceleration, cornering, hydroplaning, or peak traction characteristics. Temperature - A, B & C The temperature grades are A (the highest), B and C representing the tires resistance to the generation of heat and its ability to dissipate heat when tested under controlled conditions on a specified indoor laboratory test wheel. Sustained high temperature can cause the material of the tire to degenerate and reduce tire life, and excessive temperature can lead to sudden tire failure. Grades B and A represent higher levels of performance on the laboratory test wheel than the minimum required by law.

463,"NOTICE Low-aspect wheels and tires are easily damaged. To reduce the risk of damage: When driving on rough roads, passing over a pothole, speed bump, manhole, or curb stone, drive the vehicle slowly not to damage the tires and wheels. Damage is not covered by your vehicle warranty. Inspect the tire condition and pressure every 13,000 km (8,000 mi.). It is difficult to visually inspect for tire damage with your eyes. If any damage is found, contact your authorized HYUNDAI dealer to replace the tire. WARNING The temperature grade for this tire is established for a tire that is properly inflated and not overloaded. Excessive speed, under-inflation, over-inflation, or excessive loading, either separately or in combination, can cause heat build-up and possible sudden tire failure. This may cause loss of vehicle control resulting in an accident. Low aspect ratio tires (if equipped) The aspect ratio is lower than 50 on low aspect ratio tires. Because low aspect ratio tires are optimized for handling and braking, their sidewall is a little stiffer than a standard tire. Also low aspect ratio tires tend to be wider and consequently have increased contact with the road surface. In some instances, low aspect ratio tires may generate more road noise compared with standard tires.

481,"APPEARANCE CARE Exterior care NOTICE If you park your vehicle near a stainless steel sign or glass facade building, the vehicles exterior plastic parts such as a bumper, spoiler, garnish, lamp or outside rearview mirror might be damaged due to sunlight reflected from the sign or building. To prevent damage of the exterior plastic parts, you should avoid parking in areas where light may be reflected or use a car cover. (The exterior plastic parts applied to your vehicle may vary.) Exterior general caution It is very important to follow the label directions when using any chemical cleaner or polish. Read all warning and caution statements that appear on the label. Finish maintenance Washing To help protect your vehicles finish from rust and deterioration, wash it thoroughly and frequently at least once a month with lukewarm or cold water. If you use your vehicle for off-road driving, you should wash it after each off-road trip. Pay special attention to the removal of any accumulation of salt, dirt, mud, and other foreign materials. Make sure the drain holes in the lower edges of the doors and rocker panels are kept clear and clean. Insects, tar, tree sap, bird droppings, industrial pollution and similar deposits can damage your vehicles finish if not removed immediately. Even prompt washing with plain water may not completely remove all these deposits. A mild soap, safe for use on painted surfaces, should be used. After washing, rinse the vehicle thoroughly with lukewarm or cold water. Do not allow soap to dry on the finish. High-pressure washing  When using high-pressure washers, make sure to maintain sufficient distance from the vehicle. Insufficient clearance or excessive pressure can lead to component damage or water penetration.  Do not spray the camera, sensors or its surrounding area directly with a high pressure washer. Shock applied from high pressure water may cause the device to not operate normally.  Do not bring the nozzle tip close to boots (rubber or plastic covers) or connectors as they may be damaged if they come into contact with high pressure water. WARNING After washing the vehicle, test the brakes while driving slowly to see if they have been affected by water before getting on the road. If braking performance is impaired, dry the brakes by applying them lightly while maintaining a slow forward speed.

NOTICE Matte paint finish vehicle (if equipped) Automatic car wash which uses rotating brushes should not be used as this can damage the surface of your vehicle. A steam cleaner which washes the vehicle surface at high temperature may result the oil to adhere and leave stains that is difficult to remove. Use a soft cloth (for example, microfiber towel or sponge) when washing your vehicle and dry with a microfiber towel. When you hand wash your vehicle, you should not use a cleaner that finishes with wax. If the vehicle surface is too dirty (sand, dirt, dust, contaminant, etc.), clean the surface with water before washing the car. Waxing A good coat of wax is a barrier between your paint and contaminate. Keeping a good coat of wax on your vehicle will help protect it. Wax the vehicle when water will no longer bead on the paint. Always wash and dry the vehicle before waxing. Use a good quality liquid or paste wax, and follow the manufacturers instructions. Wax all metal trim to protect it and to maintain its luster. Removing oil, tar, and similar materials with a spot remover will usually strip the wax from the finish. Be sure to re-wax these areas even if the rest of the vehicle does not yet need waxing.

484,"Bright-metal maintenance To remove road tar and insects, use a tar remover, not a scraper or other sharp object. To protect the surfaces of brightmetal parts from corrosion, apply a coating of wax or chrome preservative and rub to a high luster. During winter weather or in coastal areas, cover the bright metal parts with a heavier coating of wax or preservative. If necessary, coat the parts with non-corrosive petroleum jelly or other protective compound. Underbody maintenance Corrosive materials used for ice and snow removal and dust control may collect on the underbody. If these materials are not removed, accelerated rusting can occur on underbody parts such as the fuel lines, frame, floor pan and exhaust system, even though they have been treated with rust protection. Thoroughly flush the vehicle underbody and wheel openings with lukewarm or cold water once a month, after off-road driving and at the end of each winter. Pay special attention to these areas because it is difficult to see all the mud and dirt. It will do more harm than good to wet down the road grime without removing it. The lower edges of doors, rocker panels, and frame members have drain holes that should not be allowed to clog with dirt; trapped water in these areas can cause rusting. WARNING After washing the vehicle, test the brakes while driving slowly to see if they have been affected by water. If braking performance is impaired, dry the brakes by applying them lightly while maintaining a slow forward speed. Aluminum wheel maintenance The aluminum wheels are coated with a clear protective finish.  Do not use abrasive cleaner, polishing compound, solvent, or wire brushes on aluminum wheels.  Clean the wheel when it has cooled.  Use only a mild soap or neutral detergent, and rinse thoroughly with water. Also, clean the wheels after driving on salted roads.  Do not wash the wheels with high- speed car wash brushes.  Do not use any cleaners containing acid or alkaline detergents.

485,"Corrosion protection Protecting your vehicle from corrosion By using the most advanced design and construction practices to combat corrosion, HYUNDAI produces vehicles of the highest quality. However, this is only part of the job. To achieve the long- term corrosion resistance your vehicle can deliver, the owners cooperation and assistance is also required. Common causes of corrosion The most common causes of corrosion on your vehicle are: Road salt, dirt and moisture that is allowed to accumulate underneath the vehicle. Removal of paint or protective coatings by stones, gravel, abrasion or minor scrapes and dents which leave unprotected metal exposed to corrosion. High-corrosion areas If you live in an area where your vehicle is regularly exposed to corrosive materials, corrosion protection is particularly important. Some of the common causes of accelerated corrosion are road salts, dust control chemicals, ocean air and industrial pollution. Moisture breeds corrosion Moisture creates the conditions in which corrosion is most likely to occur. For example, corrosion is accelerated by high humidity, particularly when temperatures are just above freezing. In such conditions, the corrosive material is kept in contact with the vehicle surfaces by moisture that is slow to evaporate. Mud is particularly corrosive because it is slow to dry and holds moisture in contact with the vehicle. Although the mud appears to be dry, it can still retain moisture and promote corrosion. High temperatures can also accelerate corrosion of parts that are not properly ventilated so the moisture can be dispersed. For all these reasons, it is particularly important to keep your vehicle clean and free of mud or accumulations of other materials. This applies not only to the visible surfaces but particularly to the underside of the vehicle.

486,"To help prevent corrosion Keep your vehicle clean The best way to prevent corrosion is to keep your vehicle clean and free of corrosive materials. Attention to the underside of the vehicle is particularly important. If you live in a high-corrosion area where road salts are used, near the ocean, areas with industrial pollution, acid rain, etc., you should take extra care to prevent corrosion. In winter, hose off the underside of your vehicle at least once a month and be sure to clean the underside thoroughly when winter is over. When cleaning underneath the vehicle, pay particular attention to the components under the fenders and other areas that are hidden from view. Do a thorough job; just dampening the accumulated mud rather than washing it away will accelerate corrosion rather than prevent it. Water under high pressure and steam are particularly effective in removing accumulated mud and corrosive materials. When cleaning lower door panels, rocker panels and frame members, be sure that drain holes are kept open so that moisture can escape and not be trapped inside to accelerate corrosion. Keep your garage dry Dont park your vehicle in a damp, poorly ventilated garage. This creates a favorable environment for corrosion. This is particularly true if you wash your vehicle in the garage or drive it into the garage when it is still wet or covered with snow, ice or mud. Even a heated garage can contribute to corrosion unless it is well ventilated so moisture is dispersed. Keep paint and trim in good condition Scratches or chips in the finish should be covered with touch-up paint as soon as possible to reduce the possibility of corrosion. If bare metal is showing through, the attention of a qualified body and paint shop is recommended. Bird droppings are highly corrosive and may damage painted surfaces in just a few hours. Always remove bird droppings as soon as possible.

487,"Interior care Interior general precautions Prevent caustic solutions such as perfume and cosmetic oil, from contacting the interior parts because they may cause damage or discoloration. If they do contact the interior parts, wipe them off immediately. See the instructions for the proper way to clean vehicle interior surfaces. NOTICE Never allow water or other liquids to come in contact with electrical/ electronic components inside the vehicle as this may damage them. When cleaning leather products (steering wheel, seats etc.), use neutral detergents or low alcohol content solutions. If you use high alcohol content solutions or acid/ alkaline detergents, the color of the leather may fade or the surface may get stripped off. Cleaning the upholstery and interior trim Vehicle interior surfaces (if equipped) Remove dust and loose dirt from interior surfaces with a whisk groom or a vacuum cleaner. If necessary, clean interior surfaces with a mixture of warm water and mild non-detergent cleaner (test all cleaners on a concealed area before use). Fabric (if equipped) Remove dust and loose dirt from fabric with a whisk broom or vacuum cleaner. Clean with a mild soap solution recommended for upholstery or carpets. Remove fresh spots immediately with a fabric spot cleaner. If fresh spots do not receive immediate attention, the fabric can be stained and its color can be affected. Also, its fire-resistant properties can be reduced if the material is not properly maintained. NOTICE Using anything but recommended cleaners and procedures may affect the fabrics appearance and fire-resistant properties.

490,"Interior wooden trim Use a wooden furniture protector (for example, wax, coating compound) to clean the interior wooden trim. Often wipe the interior wooden trim with a lint-free, clean cloth to maintain the unique wooden textures for a longer period of time. If you spill beverage (for example, water, coffee) over the interior wooden trim, immediately wipe it with clean, dry cloth. Sharp objects (for example, driver, knife), adhesive materials, or tapes may damage the interior wooden trim. Any strong impacts may damage the interior wooden trim. If the coating finish over the interior wooden trim is removed, moisture may damage or change wood traits. If the interior wooden trim is damaged, you may get a splinter from the wood surface. Therfore, we recommended to contact the nearest authorized HYUNDAI dealer to have the damaged interior wooden trim replaced. Cleaning the seat belt webbing Clean the belt webbing with any mild soap solution recommended for cleaning upholstery or carpet. Follow the instructions provided with the soap. Do not bleach or re-dye the webbing because this may weaken the seat belt. Cleaning the interior window glass If the interior glass surfaces of the vehicle become fogged (that is, covered with an oily, greasy or waxy film), they should be cleaned with glass cleaner. Follow the directions on the glass cleaner container. NOTICE Do not scrape or scratch the inside of the rear window. This may result in damage to the rear window defroster grid.

491,"EMISSION CONTROL SYSTEM 1. Crankcase emission control system The positive crankcase ventilation system is employed to prevent air pollution caused by blow-by gases being emitted from the crankcase. This system supplies fresh filtered air to the crankcase through the air intake hose. Inside the crankcase, the fresh air mixes with blow-by gases, which then pass through the PCV valve into the induction system. The emission control system of your vehicle is covered by a written limited warranty. Please see the warranty information contained in the Service Passport in your vehicle. Your vehicle is equipped with an emission control system to meet all applicable emission regulations. There are three emission control systems, as follows. (1) Crankcase emission control system (2) Evaporative emission control system (3) Exhaust emission control system In order to ensure the proper function of the emission control systems, it is recommended that you have your vehicle inspected and maintained by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer in accordance with the maintenance schedule in this manual. NOTICE For the Inspection and Maintenance Test (with Electronic Stability Control (ESC) system) To prevent the vehicle from misfiring during dynamometer testing, turn the Electronic Stability Control (ESC) system off by pressing the ESC switch (ESC OFF light illuminated). After dynamometer testing is completed, turn the ESC system back on by pressing the ESC switch again. 2. Evaporative emission control system The Evaporative Emission Control System is designed to prevent fuel vapors from escaping into the atmosphere. Canister Fuel vapors generated inside the fuel tank are absorbed and stored in the onboard canister. When the engine is running, the fuel vapors absorbed in the canister are drawn into the surge tank through the purge control solenoid valve. Purge Control Solenoid Valve (PCSV) The purge control solenoid valve is controlled by the Engine Control Module (ECM); when the engine coolant temperature is low during idling, the PCSV closes so that evaporated fuel is not taken into the engine. After the engine warms-up during ordinary driving, the PCSV opens to introduce evaporated fuel to the engine. 
",,
492,"3. Exhaust emission control system The Exhaust Emission Control System is a highly effective system which controls exhaust emissions while maintaining good vehicle performance. When the engine starts or fails to start, excessive attempts to restart the engine may cause damage to the emission system. Engine exhaust (carbon monoxide) precautions Carbon monoxide can be present with other exhaust fumes. If you smell exhaust fumes of any kind in your vehicle, drive with all the windows fully open. Have your vehicle inspected and repaired immediately. WARNING Engine exhaust gases contain carbon monoxide (CO). Though colorless and odorless, it is dangerous and could be lethal if inhaled. Follow the instructions on this page to avoid CO poisoning. Do not operate the engine in confined or closed areas (such as garages) any more than what is necessary to move the vehicle in or out of the area. When the vehicle is stopped in an open area for more than a short time with the engine running, adjust the ventilation system (as needed) to draw outside air into the vehicle. Never sit in a parked or stopped vehicle for any extended time with the engine running. When the engine stalls or fails to start, excessive attempts to restart the engine may cause damage to the emission control system. Operating precautions for catalytic converters (if equipped) WARNING The exhaust system and catalytic system are very hot while the engine is running or immediately after the engine is turned off. To avoid SERIOUS INJURY or DEATH:  Do not park, idle, or drive the vehicle over or near flammable objects, such as grass, vegetation, paper, leaves, etc. A hot exhaust system can ignite flammable items under your vehicle.  Keep away from the exhaust system and catalytic converter or you may get burned. Also, do not remove the heat sink around the exhaust system, do not seal the bottom of the vehicle, and do not coat the vehicle for corrosion control. It may present a fire risk under certain conditions. Your vehicle is equipped with a catalytic converter emission control device. To prevent damage to the catalytic converter and to your vehicle, take the following precautions:  Use only UNLEADED FUEL for gasoline engines.  Do not operate the vehicle when there are signs of engine malfunction, such as misfire or a noticeable loss of performance.  Do not misuse or abuse the engine. Examples of misuse are coasting with the engine off and descending steep grades in gear with the engine off. 
",,
493," Do not operate the engine at high idle speed for extended periods (5 minutes or more). Do not modify or tamper with any part of the engine or emission control system. We recommend that all inspections and adjustments are made by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer. Avoid driving with an extremely low fuel level. Running out of fuel could cause the engine to misfire, damaging the catalytic converter. Gasoline Particulate Filter (GPF) (if equipped) Gasoline Particulate Filter (GPF) system removes the soot in the exhaust gas. The GPF system automatically burns (or oxidizes) the accumulated soot in accordance with driving situations, unlike a disposable air filter. In other words, the accumulated soot is automatically purged out by the engine control system and by the high exhaust- gas temperature at normal/ high driving speeds. However, when the vehicle is continually driven at repeated short distances or driven at low speed for a long time, the accumulated soot may not be automatically removed because of low exhaust gas temperature. In this case, the accumulated soot may reach a certain amount regardless of the soot oxidization process, then the GPF lamp ( ) will illuminate. The Gasoline Particulate Filter (GPF) lamp stops illuminating, when the driving speed exceeds 80 km/h (50 mph) with engine RPM 1,500 ~ 4,000 and the gear in the 3rd position or above for about 30 minutes. When the GPF lamp starts to blink or the warning message Check exhaust system pops up even though the vehicle was driven as mentioned above, we recommend that you have the GPF system checked by an authorized HYUNDAI dealer. With GPF lamp blinking for an extended period of time, it may damage the GPF system and lower the fuel economy. CAUTION We recommend you to use only the regulated gasoline fuels, when your vehicle is equipped with the GPF system. When you use other gasoline fuels which contain unspecified additives, they may damage the GPF system and cause exhaust emission problems.
