10,"Driving On A Rainy Day Driving Through Water Do not drive through flooded areas. Judge the depth of water before driving through it. Otherwise, water may enter the vehicle interior or the engine compartment. If at all the situation demands that you have to drive through water then; Check wiper blades, lights and brakes for proper functioning and condition. Check the tyre treads depth, the con dition of the tread and tyre. Avoid harsh braking and sharp turns. It may cause loss of control and lead to a skid. Keep engine in higher RPM and crawl the vehicle in low gear. For slowing down, shift to lower gears and brake gently. Keep lights ON if visibility is poor Driving On Wet Roads On wet road or during light showers, Aquaplaning can occur. Aquaplaning is the loss of direct contact be-tween the road surface and the vehicles tires due to a water film forming between them. Steer ing or braking the vehicle can be very dif ficult, and loss of control can occur. There is no hard and fast rule about aqua planing. The best advice is to slow down when the road is wet. Night Driving Flowing or rushing water creates strong forces. Driving through flowing water could cause the vehicle to about trying to drive through flowing water. Ensure that all lights are working and windshield, window glasses are clean. Lightly apply the brake pedal to dry the liners until the brakes work normally once you are out of water.

15,"CHILD RESTRAINT SYSTEM (CRS) TATA MOTORS strongly recommends the use of Child Restraint Systems (CRS) for all children up to age of 12 years and to be placed at recommended positions only. Children travelling without recommended CRS and seated at other positions may face serious injuries in case of a collision. CRS can be installed in the vehicle using seat belts and/or ISOFIX only (if equipped) or ISOFIX with Top Tether (if equipped). The harness system of CRS holds the child in place, and in a collision, acts to keep the child positioned in the seat and reduce the risk of injuries. All children below age of one year must al ways ride in a rear-facing infant CRS. Keep children above age of one year, in a forward-facing CRS with a harness until they reach the size or weight limit allowed by your CRS manufacturer. Once your child outgrows the forward-fac ing CRS, your child is ready for a booster seat. Selection And Installation Of CRS Always select the CRS that complies with latest safety standards (AIS072 / ECE R44). The CRS are classified according to the childs size, height and weight. Select the appropriate CRS for your child. Ensure that the CRS is securely installed in the vehicle and subsequently child fits prop erly in it and wears harness of CRS. For installation, please refer CRS manufac turers instruction manual. NOTE The above images are for reference purpose only.

The instructions also warn against using pillows, books, or towels to boost a child's height, installing a booster seat or cushion with a slack or twisted seat belt, leaving toys or objects loose in the CRS, and leaving unattended children in the vehicle. Additionally, the instructions advise against modifying the CRS in any way and against installing a rear-facing CRS in the front passenger seat if the vehicle is equipped with a front passenger airbag (PAB) that does not have a PAB deactivation switch. The instructions also note that a CRS in a closed vehicle can become very hot, and therefore it is important to check the seating surface and buckles before placing a child in the CRS. Overall, the image and instructions provide important safety guidance for parents and caregivers who are using a CRS in their vehicles.

Rollovers collision: During a rollover col lision, unbelted occupants may float inside the passenger compartment. This will in crease the risk of injuries and may prove to be fatal. Wearing seat belts provide highly effective occupant protection during rollover collision. Front airbags, are not de signed to deploy in a rollover as frontal airbags cannot offer any protection in rollover collision. When front airbags/side airbags/side curtain airbags (if equipped) deploy with minor or no visible vehicle dam age? The airbags are triggered only when there is a collision severe enough to trigger the airbags. The extent of vehicle damage is not always the correct indicator for airbag deployment. In some extreme/rare condi tions; of rough road driving, running into a curb or hitting other fixed objects; the airbags may deploy depending upon the severity of collision. In some of these con ditions, damage to the vehicle may be minor or not be readily visible. When front airbags/side airbags/side curtain airbags (if equipped) may not deploy, even with exterior visible vehi cle damage? The airbags are triggered only when there is a collision severe enough to trigger the airbags. The amount of visible vehicle damage is not always the correct indicator for airbag deployment. Some collisions can result in visible damage but with no airbag deployment, because the airbags would not have been needed or would not have provided protection even if they had deployed. Seat belts, if worn, offer ade quate occupant protection in such cases. Airbag Deployment Conditions When front airbags should not deploy? Minor frontal collision: Seat belt (if worn) offers adequate occupant protection in low severity collisions. The airbags are trig gered only when there is a collision severe enough to trigger the airbags. Deployment of frontal airbags is not beneficial in low severity collisions. Side collision: During a side collision, oc cupants tend to move sideways. There fore, deploying frontal airbags in such situations will not benefit the occupants. Side airbags and side curtain airbags (if equipped) are specifically designed to re duce the injuries that can occur in side col lision. Rear collision: During a rear collision, oc cupants tend to move (rearwards) away WARNING Never use a rearward facing child re straint on a seat protected by an active Airbag in front of it, Death or serious in jury to the child can occur.

The table also discusses the deployment of airbags when there is minor or no visible damage to the vehicle, and when there is exterior visible vehicle damage but no airbag deployment.

ELECTRONIC STABILITY PRO GRAM (ESP) (if equipped) ELECTRONIC STABILITY PRO ADDITIONAL SAFETY FEATURES (as available) Cornering Stability Control (CSC) Corner stability Control supports / stabi lizes vehicle during partial braking on curves by reducing pressure at required inner wheel of the vehicle. This helps to reduce probability of vehicle over steering during cornering. OFF Road ABS Based on wheel speed information off road ABS helps to avoid wheel lock on un even surfaces like loose gravel, pot holes by reducing the stopping distance com pared to standard ABS. Electronic Traction Control (ETC) The Electronic Traction Control system function (ETC) is designed as a slip control system to prevent the driven wheels of a vehicle from excessive wheel slip. Roll Over Mitigation (ROM) The main feature of the Roll over Mitiga tion function is the detection of a rollover critical situation and to prevent the vehicle ESP monitors driving sta bility and traction.

Brake Disc Wiping (BDW) Water on the brake disc leads to a delay in brake response time. The purpose of the function Brake Disc wiping is to re move moisture when driving in wet condi tions automatically. To get quick response form Brake and better deceleration. Electronic Brake Pre-fill (EBP) The Electronic Brake Prefill (EBP) function reduces the air gap of the brake pad and the brake disc. The function is triggered after a sudden release of the accelerator pedal due to an unexpected emergency brake situation. By actively pre-filling the brake-system the brake response time is reduced and results in a shorter stopping distance. Hydraulic Brake Assist (HBA) brake too soft. The HBA function detects the critical situation and builds up addi tional brake pressure to reduce the brak ing distance. Hydraulic Fading Compensation (HFC) brake too soft. The HBA function detects the critical situation and builds up addi tional brake pressure to reduce the brak ing distance. Hydraulic Fading Compensation Engine Drag Torque Control (EDTC) On slippery road conditions during in- gear Braking or Shift down of gear or sudden throttle release on a curve road. This causes high Engine drag on the driven wheel resulting into brake slip situ ations without any brake application. This makes vehicle highly under steerable. EDTC controls such brake slip on the driven wheels by increasing the engine torque to makes the vehicle stable and steerable. Hill Hold Control (HHC) Hill Hold Control is a comfort function. The main intend is to prevent the vehicle from rolling backwards while driving off up-hill on an inclined surface. In dangerous fading situations most driv ers operate the brake pedal with a small or regular braking force and they never reach to the maximum possible vehicle de celeration. The HFC function improve the stopping distance by eliminating required pressure build-up lag by the driver. Dynamic Wheel Torque by Brake (DWT-B) The main goal of the function is to improve the agility of a vehicle and to enable a more direct steering. This is mainly achieved by braking interventions at the inner wheels during turning. DWT-B re duces understeer tendency of the car and a higher curve speed can be achieved.

NOTE In AUTO mode, the FATC system will regulate the blower speed automati cally. 
","<tab>The table details the various functions and operations of a climate control system, specifically referring to a Ford vehicle's Front Air Temperature Control (FATC) system. 

In automatic mode, the FATC system takes care of regulating the direction of air flow, with options to direct air through the defroster vents, center and side vents, foot wells, or a combination of these. The default mode is set to direct fresh air through the defroster and foot well vents. To operate this system, one would press the AUTO button, adjust the temperature using the knob, and have the functions displayed on the info screen. Users can also switch the system off using the OFF button, which will accordingly display the shutdown on the screen.

The FATC system aims to efficiently regulate the vehicle's interior temperature by selecting an appropriate mix of conditioned or heated air. It does this automatically when in AUTO mode, but users can also override this setting by using the MODE button to choose a specific airflow mode that suits their preference. 

Additionally, the system also has a semi-automatic operation, allowing manual selection of blower speed, among other functions, when in AUTO mode. The climate control system also has a feature to ensure safety by switching to recirculation mode, directing air through the defroster vents when the reverse gear is engaged. This prevents exhaust fumes from entering the cabin. Overall, the FATC system offers both automatic and manual control over the vehicle's climate, aiming to maximize comfort and minimize inconvenience.</tab>
<tab>The table details the different ways the car's air vents can direct air into the cabin, depending on the mode selected. There are eight modes in total. 

The first mode, accessible by pressing the AUTO button, engages the system to automatically direct air through the center and side air vents. Meanwhile, the temperature is adjusted by turning the temperature control knob. 

The second mode, activated by pressing the OFF button, shuts down the system, displaying the word ""OFF"" on the infotainment screen. 

The third mode is activated by the selection button. In this mode, the system swiftly adjusts the interior temperature to the driver's preference by selecting an appropriate mix of conditioned or heated air.
 
The fourth mode can be accessed by pressing the MODE button, which allows the user to override the automatic air distribution setting. Each press of the MODE button cycles through the available air flow modes, which are:

- Directs air through the center and side air vents
- Directs air through the center, sides, and foot wells
- Directs air only through the foot well vents
- Directs air through the defroster and foot wells (the default fresh air mode)

The fifth mode is triggered when the temperature is set to its lowest or highest limit. In this mode, the system focuses solely on cooling or heating, without regulating the interior temperature. 

The final mode, engaged when the car is put into reverse, switches the air inlet to recirculation mode if it is in fresh air mode. This is a safety measure to prevent exhaust fumes from entering the vehicle's cabin.

Overall, these modes offer a variety of climate control options for the vehicle's cabin.</tab>

You can get extra braking from the en gine by shifting to a lower gear. This can help you to maintain a safe speed and prevent your brakes from over heating specially while going down a hill. Tips For Obtaining Better Fuel Effi ciency Do not accelerate excessively when you are in lower gears (1st or 2nd). Be gentle on the accelerator when you are in traffic. In lower gears, opening up the throttle will increase the engine rpm while keeping the vehicle at lower speeds. This reduces the fuel effi ciency of the vehicle. Slow down before you shift to a lower gear. This helps the engine to keep a lower rpm and result in less wear and tear of the engine components. Always maintain the specified tyre pressure during fuel top-ups and also before a long trip. Vehicle running with low tyre pressure will consume more fuel than the one running with specified tyre pressure. Be in the maximum possible higher gear at a given speed. This reduces the engine operating speeds which means the engine is running at lower rpm (Revolutions per Minute) for the same vehicle speed. Lesser the num ber of engine revolution lesser the fuel burned. Avoid harsh braking. Maintain healthy driving habits & while Avoid frequent brake application which can cause overheating of brakes. Slow down the vehicle when you drive in cross winds to get better control over the vehicle. Keep the vehicle clean. Get rid of the unwanted stuff lying in the boot etc., to reduce weight. Avoid high speed when cornering or turning. Press the clutch fully while shifting Regularly inspect your vehicle for any leakages, worn out wires by rat bites etc. 
","<tab>The table contains data on recommended fuel economy speeds for a vehicle with a manual transmission (MT) organized by gear. It pairs diesel and petrol engines with their respective speeds in kilometers per hour (kmph) for each gear.

The first gear is designed to reach speeds of up to 20 kmph for both diesel and petrol engines. The second and third gears will allow you to reach 30 kmph and 45 kmph, respectively, regardless of the engine type. The fourth gear is for speeds up to 65 kmph, while the fifth gear is calibrated for speeds of 80 kmph. Interestingly, the sixth gear seems to have the same speed capability of 100 kmph for both engine types.

It's important to remember that this data represents recommended speeds for fuel efficiency and that actual vehicle performance may vary based on many factors. Drivers should also exercise caution and adapt their driving habits to match road conditions.

In addition to the gear and speed information, the provided text offers insights into good driving practices and tips for achieving better fuel efficiency. Some of these include avoiding excessive acceleration, especially in lower gears, maintaining regular vehicle servicing, and ensuring the vehicle is stationary before engaging reverse gear. Following these recommendations can help improve fuel efficiency, enhance safety, and reduce wear and tear on the vehicle.</tab>

This involves gentle acceleration and not revving the en gine too much. This is done by changing gears early for the first 1,500 1,800 km. This will increase the life of the engine. The more you look after the engine when it is new, the more satisfied you will be with its performance in the future. Do not exceed the following road speeds during running in period. Use the car AC only when you require. For cooling, keep the blower speeds low, as at higher blower speeds, the AC consumes more electric power which is ultimately drawn from engine by burning fuel. Avoid unnecessary extra electrical loading on the car. Stop the engine wisely at traffic sig nals. Switch OFF the engine at the traffic signal only if the stoppage time is high (typically more than 30 sec). When you drive on highways, close all the windows. This reduces the drag on the vehicle and improves fuel effi ciency. Do not over speed. Follow the speed limits. With increasing speed, the en gine rpm increases to overcome exter nal air resistance and this reduces fuel efficiency.

Choose as smooth a slope as possible and select the appropriate gear so that gear changing in the middle of the climb is not required. Changing gears in the middle of the climb can cause loss of momentum and engine stalling. Shifting to lower gear has to be done cautiously to avoid loss of traction. Under no conditions should the vehicle be moved diagonally across a hill. The dan ger is in loss of traction and sideways slip page, possibly resulting in toppling over. If unavoidable, choose as mild an angle as possible and keep the vehicle moving. If the wheels start to slip within few feet of the end of the climb, motion can be main tained by swinging the steered wheels left and right, thereby providing increased grip.

If unavoidable, choose a mild angle and keep the vehicle moving. If the tyres start to slip within few feet at the end of the climb, keep the vehicle sta ble by steering left and right. It gives in creased grip to the tyres. If the vehicle stalls or losses headway while climbing a steep hill, make a quick shift to reverse and allow the vehicle to move back with the help of engine brak ing. Descending Sharp Gradients Depending on the severity of the gradient, shift into appropriate gear. Use engine braking judiciously without over-revving the engine. Brake gently in such situations. Driving Climbing Sharp Gradients On Loose Surfaces Start off smoothly in a suitable gear. Accel erate smoothly so that there is no loss of traction by over-revving of the engine. Choose a smooth slope and select the ap propriate gear so that gear changing in the middle of the climb is not required. Changing gears in the middle of the climb can cause loss of momentum and engine stalling. Shifting to lower gear has to be done cautiously to avoid loss of traction. Braking Your vehicle has vacuum assisted brakes. The distance needed to bring the vehicle to a halt increases with the speed of the vehicle.

Inflate the tire within about 10 minutes 9. to an inflation pressure of minimum 180 kPa, (1.8 bar, and 26 psi) and a maximum of 300 kPa (3 bar, 43 psi). Inflate the tire within about 10 minutes 9. Switch off the compressor briefly in 10. Slowly unscrew the hose from the tire valve (sealant residues may escape from the hose) and put the protective cap back onto the hose. Leave the bottle in the holder. This Check the sidewall of the tire prior to in flation. If there are any cracks, bumps or similar damage, do not attempt to in flate the tire. Do not stand directly be side the tire while the compressor is pumping. Watch the sidewall of the tire. If any cracks, bumps or similar damage appear, turn off the compressor and let the air out by means of the pressure air release valve. In this case, do not con tinue to use the tire. WARNING If heavy vibrations, unsteady steering behavior or noises should occur while driving, reduce your speed and drive with caution to a place where it is safe for you to stop the vehicle. Recheck the tire and its pressure. If the tire pressure is less than 130 kPa (1.3 bar, 19 psi) or if there are any visible cracks, bumps or similar damage on the side wall, do not continue to use the tire!

Furthermore, it suggests referring to the tyre pressure sticker provided on the vehicle for clarity, indicating that the pressures listed are for reference only. This sticker likely provides the specific pressures recommended for that particular vehicle, ensuring more accurate maintenance.

Overall, the table serves as a reminder of the significance of tyre pressure maintenance and encourages drivers to adopt a proactive approach to tyre care, including regular checks, to ensure safety, enhance performance, and prolong the lifespan of the tyres.</tab>
<tab>The table offers a comprehensive guide to understanding the impact of tyre pressure on vehicle performance and tyre longevity. It explicitly highlights the consequences of under-inflation and over-inflation on various aspects of driving. 

Under-inflation is associated with a reduction in comfort and handling, leading to excessive side tread wear. It also increases the operating temperature, which might potentially result in tyre failure. Conversely, over-inflation causes bumpy rides and excessive central tread wear. 

The ideal scenario is to maintain the correct tyre pressure, as indicated on the vehicle's tyre pressure sticker. This ensures uniform wear and optimizes vehicle performance while enhancing tyre life. Regular checks are vital, not only for pressure but also for examining the tyre's overall condition, including the treads, to ensure safety and longevity.

200,"Wheel Alignment Incorrect wheel alignment causes exces sive and uneven tyre wear. Check wheel alignment at specified intervals. Wheel Balancing Wheels of your vehicle are balanced for better ride comfort and longer tyre life. Bal ancing needs to be done whenever tyre is removed from rim. Special Care For Tubeless Tyres When you remove the tyre and install it back on the rim, take precautions not to damage tyre bead. Use tyre removal and assembly machines. Damage or cut on tyre bead may cause gradual loss of air and deflation of tyre. Do not scratch the inner surface of tubeless tyre with metallic or sharp ob ject. Tubeless tyres are coated with im permeable layer of rubber from the inner surface which holds the air in the tyre. Removal of this layer due to scratching may cause gradual loss of air and deflation. If wheel rim gets damaged in service, get the wheel rim repaired/ replaced immediately. Running the vehicle with damaged rim may cause deflation of tyre and subsequent dislodging of tyre from rim. Keep the recommended inflation pres sure. Over-inflation, in particular, may cause puncture or bursting of tyre. NOTE WARNING Life and wear pattern of tyres depends on various parameters like tyre pres sure, wheel alignment, wheel balanc ing, tyre rotation, etc. It also largely depends on vehicle speed, load carried, usage, driving habits, road conditions, tyre quality, etc. In case fault is sus pected to be due to poor quality of tyres, the same may be taken up with con cerned tyre manufacturer.
