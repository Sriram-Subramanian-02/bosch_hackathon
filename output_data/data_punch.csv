9,"Driving on a Rainy Day Driving Through Water Do not drive through flooded areas. Judge the depth of water before driving through it. Otherwise, water may enter the vehicle interior or the engine compartment. If at all the situation demands that you have to drive through water then; Check wiper blades, lights and brakes for proper functioning and condition. Check the tyre treads depth, the con dition of the tread and tyre. Keep engine in higher RPM and crawl the vehicle in low gear. Avoid harsh braking and sharp turns. It may cause loss of control and lead to a skid. For slowing down, shift to lower gears and brake gently. Keep lights ON if visibility is poor. Driving on Wet Roads On wet road or during light showers, Aquaplaning can occur. Aquaplaning is the loss of direct contact between the road surface and the vehicles tires due to a water film forming between them. Steering or braking the vehicle can be very difficult, and loss of control can occur. There is no hard and fast rule about aquaplaning. The best advice is to slow down when the road is wet. Night Driving Flowing or rushing water creates strong forces. Driving through flowing water could cause the vehicle to about trying to drive through flowing water. Ensure that all lights are working and windshield, window glasses are clean. Drive more slowly at night than in the daytime, as the visual range is re stricted at night. Maintain a speed such that you can stop within illuminated distance of head lamps. Lightly apply the brake pedal to dry the liners until the brakes work normally once you are out of water. Do not use the high beam unless in evitable. It may dazzle the driver of the oncoming vehicle, thus causing an ac cident. Use head lamp main/dip beam to alert other road users on turns/ cross roads. Use side indicators for lane change or turning. NOTE If you have driven for a long time in heavy rain without braking, there may be a delayed reaction from the brakes when braking for the first time. You have to press the brake pedal more firmly. Maintain a greater distance from the ve hicle in front. WARNING Do not attempt to start the engine if ve hicle gets flooded due to water.

14,"CHILD RESTRAINT SYSTEM (CRS) TATA MOTORS strongly recommends the use of Child Restraint Systems (CRS) for all children up to age of 12 years and to be placed at recommended positions only. Children travelling without recommended CRS and seated at other positions may face serious injuries in case of a collision. CRS can be installed in the vehicle using seat belts and/or ISOFIX only (if equipped) or ISOFIX with Top Tether (if equipped) or ISOFIX with support leg. If the child seat is equipped with support leg(s), always fit the support leg(s) directly to the floor. Never fit support leg(s) to a footrest or on any other object. The harness system of CRS holds the child in place, and in a collision, acts to keep the child positioned in the seat and reduce the risk of injuries. All children below age of two years must always ride in a rear-facing infant CRS. Keep children in a forward-facing CRS with a harness until they reach the size or weight limit allowed by your CRS manu facturer. Once your child outgrows the forward-fac ing CRS, your child is ready for a booster seat. Selection and Installation of CRS Always select the CRS that complies with latest safety standards (AIS072 / ECE R44). The CRS are classified according to the childs size, height and weight. Select the appropriate CRS for your child. Ensure that the CRS is securely installed in the vehicle and subsequently child fits prop erly in it and wears harness of CRS. For installation, please refer CRS manufac turers instruction manual.

","<tab>The table provides insights into the recommended positions for installing child restraint systems (CRS) in vehicles based on the child's age and weight groups. It offers a comprehensive view of the suitability of different seating positions within the vehicle for various child age and weight categories.

For the '0' group, which encompasses children weighing up to 10kg and aged up to 9 months, the table indicates that the front passenger seat is unsuitable for them. The rear outer positions, both on the left and right sides, are marked as 'U,' signifying that they are suitable for universal category restraints. The '0+' group, catering to children up to 13kg and 24 months old, aligns with the previous group's recommendations. This implies that the front seat is still not suitable, while the rear outer positions are recommended for universal category restraints.

As we move to the 'I' group, which is for children weighing between 9 and 18kg and aged from 9 months to 48 months, the table suggests that the front seat remains unsuitable. However, the rear outer positions are now marked as 'U,L,' meaning they are suitable for both universal and specific vehicle restraints. This pattern continues for the 'II' group, catering to children aged approximately 3 to 7 years and weighing between 15 and 25kg. The front seat is mentioned as unsuitable, while the rear outer positions are recommended for universal and particular vehicle restraints.

Finally, the 'III' group, intended for older children weighing between 22 and 36kg and approximately 6 to 12 years old, maintains the unsuitability of the front seat and suggests that the rear center and outer positions are suitable for universal restraints. The table also includes a cautionary note emphasizing the potential dangers of seating a child in the front seat, highlighting the risk of serious injury or even death in the event of a collision.</tab>

The Airbag will neither hinder your view nor make it harder to exit the vehicle. Airbag inflation is virtually instantaneous and occurs with considerable force, ac companied by loud noise and smoke, which is normal. The inflated airbag, to gether with seat belts, limit the movement of an occupant, thereby reducing the risk of injury. When an airbag inflates, you may see some smoke-like particles. The particles are a normal by-product of the process that generates the non-toxic gas used for airbag inflation. These airborne particles may irritate the skin, eyes, nose, or throat. If you have skin or eye irritation, rinse the area with water. For nose or throat irrita tion, move to fresh air. Also sometimes the smoke can cause breathing problems. In such cases, it is recommended to get fresh air promptly. After inflation, airbag provides a gradual cushioning effect for the occupant there after deflates.

Gear Petrol Speed(kmph) Gear Petrol Anticipate the road conditions and drive in a smooth manner. You can get extra braking from the en gine by shifting to a lower gear. This can help you to maintain a safe speed and prevent your brakes from over heating specially while going down a hill. Tips For Obtaining Better Fuel Effi ciency Do not accelerate excessively when you are in lower gears (1st or 2nd). Be gentle on the accelerator when you are in traffic. In lower gears, opening up the throttle will increase the engine rpm while keeping the vehicle at lower speeds. This reduces the fuel effi ciency of the vehicle. 55 75 95 Good Driving Practices Slow down before you shift to a lower gear. This helps the engine to keep a lower rpm and result in less wear and tear of the engine components. Always maintain the specified tyre pressure during fuel top-ups and also before a long trip. Vehicle running with low tyre pressure will consume more fuel than the one running with specified tyre pressure. Be in the maximum possible higher gear at a given speed. This reduces the engine operating speeds which means the engine is running at lower rpm (Revolutions per Minute) for the same vehicle speed. Lesser the num ber of engine revolution lesser the fuel burned. Avoid harsh braking. Avoid frequent brake application which can cause overheating of brakes. Slow down the vehicle when you drive in cross winds to get better control over the vehicle. Keep the vehicle clean. Get rid of the unwanted stuff lying in the boot etc., to reduce weight. Regularly inspect your vehicle for any leakages, worn out wires, damaged by rat bites etc. Always follow periodic & regular serv Avoid high speed when cornering or turning.

The highest speed recorded in the table is 95 kmph for the fifth gear. This data suggests that the vehicle's speed increases progressively with each higher gear.

In addition to the gear and petrol speed pairings, the table also includes recommendations for driving practices. It advises drivers to ensure the vehicle is stationary before engaging reverse gear and to exercise caution by driving slowly on wet roads. To improve fuel economy, the notes suggest driving smoothly, gently accelerating in lower gears, and avoiding excessive throttle. 

The table also offers tips for better fuel efficiency, emphasizing the importance of gentle acceleration, especially in lower gears. It advises against harsh braking and encourages drivers to slow down before shifting to lower gears. Maintaining recommended tyre pressure and vehicle weight are also suggested as good driving practices. Regular vehicle inspection and adherence to service schedules are recommended to ensure optimal performance and fuel efficiency. Overall, the table provides a concise overview of gear ratios, safety tips, and fuel-efficient driving strategies for a vehicle.</tab>

Accel erate smoothly so that there is no loss of traction by over-revving of the engine. Choose a smooth slope and select the ap propriate gear so that gear changing in the middle of the climb is not required. Changing gears in the middle of the climb can cause loss of momentum and engine stalling. Shifting to lower gear has to be done cautiously to avoid loss of traction. Under no conditions should the vehicle be moved diagonally across a hill. The dan ger is in loss of traction and side-ways slip page, possibly resulting in toppling over. If unavoidable, choose a mild angle and keep the vehicle moving. If the tyres start to slip within few feet at the end of the climb, keep the vehicle sta ble by steering left and right. It gives in creased grip to the tyres. If the vehicle stalls or losses headway while climbing a steep hill, make a quick Authorized Dealer/Service Center. Press the clutch fully when gear shifting. The reverse gear should be engaged only when the vehicle is stationary. Use the clutch only to shift gears and do not use it when vehicle is stationary on a slope, as the car will roll down due to gravity.

This sagging causes a margin of error between the distance guidelines displayed on the screen and the actual distance on the road. The distance guidelines are designed for flat surfaces, and they cannot accurately determine the position of three-dimensional objects like vehicles. When approaching a three-dimensional object, the distance guidelines appear further from the vehicle than the actual distance, making the object appear closer than it is. This discrepancy creates a margin of error between the guidelines and the actual distance/course on the road.

Three lines labelled A, B, and C are drawn from the vehicles to the top of the image. Lines A and B are vertical and line C is horizontal. Line C shows the difference in height between the two vehicles. This image is used to illustrate the concept that when a vehicle is sagging, the distance guidelines shown on the screen may not be accurate. This is because the guidelines are based on the assumption that the vehicle is level, and when it is not, the distance between the vehicle and the objects on the road will be different from what the guidelines indicate. This can lead to an inaccurate perception of distance, as objects may appear closer than they actually are.

It illustrates the concept of distance and width perception in relation to a vehicle's rearview camera. The image highlights the potential for misinterpreting distances and object sizes through the camera's lens, leading to potentially dangerous situations. Point A appears closest, while C appears furthest away, but in reality, A and C are at the same distance, and B is the furthest away. Similarly, a truck appears to be outside of the vehicle width guidelines, but the rear body of the truck may actually cross over them. These discrepancies emphasize the importance of visually checking the surroundings and considering potential misinterpretations when relying on the rearview camera alone.

165,"Instructions On How To Use The Puncture Repair Kit Safely Never leave the Puncture repair Kit un attended while in use. Use product with original vehicle ground tires only. Do not keep the compressor operating for more than 10 minutes otherwise there is a risk of it over-heating. Inform all other users of the vehicle that the tire has been temporarily sealed with the Puncture repair Kit and make them aware of the special driving conditions to be observed. Only use the Puncture repair Kit with tubeless tires. Replace the sealant bottle with a new one before the expiration date is reached (see bottle label). In case that the sealant is expired the functionality cannot be fully guaranteed. Only use original Puncture re-pair Kit bottles which are pressure resistant. How To Proceed In The Event Of Tyre Puncture You can temporarily repair a tire puncture in two steps. If used for other than its intended pur pose, the Puncture repair Kit may cause severe accident or injury due to the fact that compressed air can act as an explosive or propellant. Step 1 :pumping The Tyre Sealant And Air Into The Tyre Park your vehicle at the roadside so that you do not obstruct the flow of traf fic and you are able to use the Punc ture repair Kit without being in danger. Peel off the decal denoting the maxi 1. mum permissible speed (80 km/h | 50 mph) from the casing and attach it to the edge of the windscreen as shown on the picture. Engage the hand brake, even if you have parked on a level road, to ensure that the vehicle will not move. First pump the tire sealant and air into the tire (see Step 1). Immediately thereafter, drive a short distance (3-10 km / 2-6 miles) in order to distribute the sealant in the tire. After that, check the tire pressure and pump more air into the tire if necessary (see Step 2). Then you can proceed to drive with caution for a maximum distance of 200 km (120 miles) and at a maxi-mum speed of 80 km/h (50 mph). Take the hose and power plug with 2. cable out of the Puncture repair Kit casing. Unscrew the orange cap of the bottle connector.

","<tab>The table contains information on the location and function of fuses in a vehicle's dashboard. The left side of the dashboard has been refitted with new lugs and slots to hold the fuses in place. Fuses F1, F2, F3, and F4 are aligned at the bottom and secured at the top in corresponding slots. 

Fuse F1 is for the tailgate release mechanism and is rated at 10A, while F2 and F4 are rated at 5A each, controlling functions like RPAS, telematics, and accessories. There are two fuses rated at 20A each, F7 and F8, which are part of the Base/Mid BCM system. The Base/Mid BCM system also has a fuse, F9, rated at 10A. 

Other fuses are located in the cabin compartment, with functions like heated rear screen, HVAC, and power sockets, ranging from 5A to 30A in rating. The immobilizer, cluster, and blower motor have their fuses, rated from 5A to 15A. 

This information seems to be a part of instructions for replacing or checking fuses, with clear indications of the fuse locations and their corresponding functions.</tab>
<tab>The table contains information on fuse ratings and their corresponding functions. There are two tables merged into one, the first being titled 'Re-fitment Procedure' and the second, 'Cabin Compartment Fuse Rating'. The first table provides a general instruction, while the second one details the fuse ratings and their respective functions. 

The ""Cabin Compartment Fuse Rating"" table reveals that the tailgate release fuse, rated at 10A, is linked to the relay coil. A 5A fuse, designated as F2, is responsible for the RPAS/Telematics ignition. The 15A fuse, F3, powers the accessories fuse and PEPS/blower relay. Several fuses, rated at 5A, are associated with functions like the immobiliser, key-in battery, cluster, and PEPS/ESCL ECU-battery. One of the 5A fuses is labeled F16 and corresponds to the relay coil. The CDL and another key-in battery fuse, both rated at 15A, are listed as F18 and F19, respectively. The blower motor is linked to a 30A fuse, F21, and the transist/infotainment system to a 20A fuse, F22.

The second table, titled ""Cabin Compartment Fuse,"" provides clarity on the fuse locations. It lists fuses F1 to F16, with F1 being assigned to the tailgate release and F16 to the relay coil. Fuses F2 and F3 are positioned as neighboring 5A and 15A fuses, respectively. There are two 5A fuses labeled as F4, with one associated with accessories and the other with PEPS/blower relay. The immobilizer and CDL fuses, F17 and F18, are rated at 5A and 15A. This table continues to assign functions to their respective fuse ratings, including the blower motor and transist/infotainment fuses, F21 and F22. 

Overall, the data relates to automotive fuses and their various ratings and functions, offering insights into the vehicle's electrical system.</tab>

","<tab>The table provides insights into maintaining the functionality of a vehicle, specifically focusing on tire pressure, its relation to inflation, and the resulting tire wear. It offers a clear guideline for understanding the consequences of incorrect tire pressure. 

Starting with the importance of maintaining correct tire pressure, the information emphasizes that under-inflation leads to excessive side tread wear. This issue can be detrimental, as it not only affects the vehicle's performance but also accelerates the tire's deterioration. The table suggests that the recommended pressure range for optimal performance and safety is 0.8 to 0.9 mm. 

In contrast, over-inflation causes excessive central tread wear. While this might not seem as harmful as under-inflation, it nevertheless results in an uneven and inefficient wear pattern, which could eventually compromise the vehicle's handling and stability. 

Correct tire pressure, on the other hand, promotes uniform wear, ensuring the tires' longevity and preserving the vehicle's overall performance. The text also emphasizes the importance of periodic checks, not only for pressure but also for the general condition of the tires, which, if ignored, could lead to unforeseen complications. 

Furthermore, the safety precautions related to tire maintenance are emphasized, especially concerning the battery. The battery, containing sulphuric acid, poses a potential hazard, warranting caution during maintenance and urging the use of protective gear. 

Lastly, the summary stresses the significance of using recommended spark plugs for replacement purposes, ensuring vehicle compatibility and performance. Overall, the data serves as a concise manual for tire maintenance, highlighting the interplay of pressure, inflation, and wear, while also addressing safety concerns and the use of appropriate replacements parts.</tab>

212,"CAR CARE Your vehicle is subjected to many external influences such as climate, road condi tions, industrial pollution and proximity to the sea. These conditions demand regular care of the vehicle body. Dirt, insects, bird droppings, oil, grease, fuel and stone chip pings should be removed as soon as pos sible. Washing Following these tips while washing your vehicle. Always wash your vehicle in shade and the surface is at room temperature. Wash with mild vehicle wash soap like Car Shampoo and use a soft bristle brush, sponge or soft cloth and rinse it fre quently while washing to avoid scratches. To avoid scratches, please wear soft gloves. Remove finger rings, nails, wrist watch while washing. To remove stubborn stains and contami nants like tar, use turpentine or cleaners like Stain remover which are safe for paint surfaces. Avoid substances like petrol, diesel, kerosene, benzene, thinner, ac-ids or other solvents that cause damage to paint. Dry your vehicle thoroughly to pre-vent any damp spots. Rinse all surfaces thoroughly to prevent any traces of soap and other cleaners as this may lead to the formation of stains on the painted surface later. After drying the vehicle, inspect it for chips and scratches that could allow corrosion to start. Apply touch up paint where nec essary. Cleaning of Carpets Vacuum clean the carpet regularly to re move dirt. Dirt will make the carpet wear out faster. Periodically, shampoo the car pet to keep it looking new. Use carpet cleaners (preferably foam type). Follow the instructions that come with the cleaner. Apply it with a sponge or soft brush. Keep the carpeting as dry as possible by not adding water to the foam. WARNING Do not direct high pressure washer fluid/ water jets (Pres-sure above 0.5 bar) at electrical devices and connecter during washing. This is to prevent mal- function / failure of electrical sys-tem due to water ingress. NOTE Avoid parking the car under trees with out proper cover, it will reduce the amount of bird droppings, tree sap and pollen contact on paint surface. Regu larly remove the twigs, leaves and veg etation near the windshield areas, to avoid water stagnation.
